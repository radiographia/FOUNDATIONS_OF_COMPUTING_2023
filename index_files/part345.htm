According to this definition, the two primary objectives of an operating system are:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Make a computer system easier to use. </b>A computer system consists of one or more processors, main memory, and many types of I/O devices such as disks, tapes, terminals, network interfaces, etc. Writing programs for using these hardware resources correctly and efficiently is a difficult job, requiring in-depth knowledge of functioning of these resources. Hence, to make computer systems usable by a large number of users, we need some mechanism to shield the programmers and other users from the complexity of hardware resources. This is achieved by putting a layer of software on top of the bare hardware. This layer of software manages all hardware resources of the system, and presents the users with an interface or <i>virtual machine </i>that is easier, safer, and efficient to program and use. It is called the operating system.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part345.htm#bookmark1864" class="s3">Figure </a>10.1<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows the logical architecture of a computer system. As shown, operating system layer surrounds hardware resources. Then a layer of other system software (such as compilers, editors, utilities, etc.) and a set of application software (such as commercial data processing applications, scientific and engineering applications, entertainment and educational applications, etc.) surrounds operating system layer. Finally, end users view the computer system in terms of the user interfaces of the application software.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 117pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="370" height="190" alt="image" src="Image_606.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1864">Figure 10.1. </a><span class="s21">Logical architecture of a computer system. Operating system hides details of hardware from the programmers and other users and provides them with a convenient interface for using the system.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Manage the resources of a computer system. </b>An operating system manages the resources of a computer system. This involves performing such tasks as keeping track of who is using what resources, granting resource requests, accounting for resource usage, and mediating conflicting requests from different processes and users. Efficient and fair sharing of system resources among users and/or processes is a key goal of all operating systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part344.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part346.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
