Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. No single method is suitable for converting all types of systems, and the choice of a particular method depends on the prevailing conversion circumstances. These methods are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Immediate Changeover</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part238.htm#bookmark1456" class="s23">In this method, the deployment team and user organization decide a suitable cut-off date jointly, and make the new system operational from that day onwards [</a><a href="part238.htm#bookmark1456" class="s3">Figure </a>7.9<span class="p">(a)]. Operation of the old system stops from that day.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This method is risky because any failure in the new system during the changeover process may cause total breakdown of those operations of the organization that are dependent on the new and old systems. The work cannot progress because the old system is not operational.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Organizations prefer this method in those situations where available manpower and changeover time is less, and the system is not so critical in the sense that some problem during the changeover process would not lead to a disaster or great loss to the organization.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Parallel Run</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part238.htm#bookmark1456" class="s23">In this method, the organization operates both the old and new systems parallely with the same data for the initial three to four cycles [</a><a href="part238.htm#bookmark1456" class="s3">Figure </a>7.9<span class="p">(b)]. During this overlapping period of complete operation of the two systems, end users compare the results produced by the new system with those produced by the old system to develop confidence in the new system. They may discover some discrepancies. Often, these are due to inaccurate design of the old system, or due to missing program logic, or due to mistakes in the program itself. Programmers correct them by further debugging before the conversion is complete.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This is the safest method because of the availability of the old system as a backup. If there are problems in the new system, there is no interruption of work because the old system is still in operation. The team can correct the problems found while the old system is still in use.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This method, however, is expensive because the organization needs additional manpower during the overlapping period for operation of the two systems. Due to the requirement of additional manpower, the organization is under considerable strain during the period of parallel operation, and organizational breakdown may occur, if the period of parallel operation is long. Hence, the deployment team must ensure that they do not carry on parallel operation any longer than needed to establish confidence in the new system. Continuing it too long is a sign of weakness in the new system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Organizations do not prefer to use this method in situations where manpower resource is scarce.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is also not suitable for use in situations where the new system greatly differs from the old system in its functions, input, and output.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1455">Phased Conversion</a></h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part238.htm#bookmark1456" class="s23">In this method, the complete changeover to the new system takes place incrementally over a period [</a><a href="part238.htm#bookmark1456" class="s3">Figure </a>7.9<span class="p">(c)]. The deployment team and user organization implement the new system gradually in parts. The end users compare the results produced by each part of the new system with the results of the old system. The team corrects any discrepancies or errors found. As soon as the organization develops confidence in a particular part, the team phases in that part of the new system, and phases out the corresponding part (operations) of the old system. This approach continues for each part of the new system. Hence, over a period, the team phases in the new system gradually, and phases out the old system gradually.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="370" height="639" alt="image" src="Image_455.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1456">Figure 7.9. </a><span class="s21">Methods of system changeover to the new system.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1457">This method is not as expensive as the parallel run method because changeover process being gradual, the organization can handle the changeover with existing manpower. Moreover, there is no danger of interruption of work, if there are problems with the new system because the corresponding part of the old system is still in operation. Users also get sufficient time to become familiar with the new system. Hence, they can handle the new system confidently when the deployment team hands over the complete system to them.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Organizations, however, cannot use this method in situations where the time supplied for conversion process is short, or when the new system significantly differs from the old system.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part237.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part239.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
