Each of these locations can store a fixed number of bits called <i>word length </i><a href="part110.htm#bookmark978" class="s23">of the memory. Hence, as </a><a href="part110.htm#bookmark978" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">4.4</span> shows, a given memory is divided into <i>N </i>words, where <i>N </i>is generally some power of 2. Each word or location has a built-in and unique number assigned to it. This number is called <i>address </i>of the location and is used to identify the location. Each location can hold either a data item or an instruction and its address remains the same, regardless of its contents. The first address starts at 0 and the highest address equals the number of words that can be stored in the memory minus 1. For example, if a memory has 1024 locations, its address ranges between 0 and 1023. Hence, at address 0 we find a word, at address 1 a second word, at address 2 a third word, and so on, up to the final word at the last address (1023).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="401" height="222" alt="image" src="Image_311.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark978">Figure 4.4. </a><span class="s21">Organization of a main memory having N words.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is an important difference between address of a memory location and its content. A memory is like a large cabinet having as many drawers as there are addresses in memory. Each drawer contains a word and address of each word is written on the drawer. If we write or store a word, say 10101010 at address 125, it is like placing the word 10101010 in the drawer labeled</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark979">125. Later, reading from address 125 is like looking in that drawer to see its content, which is 10101010. We do not remove the word at an address when we read its content, but its content changes when we store or write a new word in it. Hence, entering data into a storage location is </a><i>destructive </i>of previous content, but retrieving data from a location is <i>non-destructive</i>. The act of entering data into a storage location is called <i>memory write operation</i>, and the act of retrieving data from a storage location is called <i>memory read operation</i>. Hence, read is a non-destructive operation and write is a destructive operation.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Why More Bits?</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You might have heard about 16-bit computers, 32-bit computers, 64-bit computers, etc. They refer to memory word length (total number of bits per memory word) of a computer. Word length of small computers is 8, 16, or 32 bits, whereas that of large computers is 64 bits or more. The obvious question that arises is - “What is the advantage of having more number of bits per word, instead of having more words of smaller size (length)?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For an answer to this question, imagine a highway with eight lanes and a heavy flow of traffic. If we expand it to sixteen lanes, traffic flow speeds up considerably. “8 bits” is analogous to number of “lanes” on a microchip. More bits mean a more rapid flow of electronic signals, in other words, a faster computer. Hence, the amount of data that an 8-bit computer can transfer to and from memory in one minute, a 32-bit computer may transfer in a few seconds.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Data and instructions move to and from memory as one or more words at a time. Therefore, even if the electronic circuits used are comparable in speed, computers having smaller word length will be slower in operation than computers having larger word length. This difference is analogous to providing the user of a computer having smaller word length with a small data shovel and the user of a computer having larger word length with a large data shovel. Even though they both may be shoveling at comparable speeds, the user with smaller shovel will be slower because he/she needs more shovelfuls to move the same amount of data.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Fixed and Variable Word-length Memory</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Main memory of some computers can store a fixed number of characters (equal to its word- length in bytes) in each numbered address location. Such computers are said to be <i>word- addressable </i>and they employ <i>fixed-word-length </i>memory approach. These computers always allocate storage space in multiples of word-length. Therefore, if a word-addressable computer has fixed word-length of 4 bytes (4 characters), it will require one word (4 bytes) to store the word “CAT” and two words (8 bytes) to store the word “BOMBAY”.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In many computers, main memory is designed to store a single character (A, B, 1, 2, +, -, etc.) at each numbered address. Computers designed in this manner are said to be <i>character-addressable </i>and they employ <i>variable-word-length </i><a href="part110.htm#bookmark980" class="s23">memory approach. Hence, in these computers only 3 bytes are required to store the word “CAT” and 6 bytes to store the word “BOMBAY”. </a><a href="part110.htm#bookmark980" class="s3">Figure</a></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part110.htm#bookmark980" class="s3">4.5</a><a href="part110.htm#bookmark980" class="s24"> </a><a href="part110.htm#bookmark980" class="s23">summarizes the difference between fixed-word-length and variable-word-length </a>memory approaches.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Both fixed and variable word-length memory systems have their own merits and demerits. Normally, large scientific computers use fixed-word-length approach for gaining speed of calculation, while small business computers use variable-word-length approach for optimizing use of storage space. For example, let us consider a fixed-word-length memory computer with a word size of eight characters. If most of the data words to be stored are of less than five characters, more than half of its storage space will remain unused. This will not happen in case of a computer with variable-word-length memory because it can place a character in every storage cell. However, word-addressable computers possess faster calculating capability because they can add two data words in a single operation. If word length of a computer that uses fixed- word-length approach is eight characters, it can add two eight-digit numbers in a single operation. On the other hand, a character-addressable computer can add only one digit in each</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">number during a single operation, and would need eight steps to add two eight-digit numbers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We can design a computer to employ either fixed-word-length or variable-word-length memory organization. These computers have an instruction set, using which we can operate them as either variable- or fixed-word-length memory computers. However, with memory becoming cheaper and larger day-by-day, most modern computers employ fixed-word-length memory organization.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="186" alt="image" src="Image_312.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark980">Figure 4.5. </a><span class="s21">Fixed-word-length memory compared with variable-word-length memory.</span><a name="bookmark981">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part109.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part111.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
