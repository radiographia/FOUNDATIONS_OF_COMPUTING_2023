All computer systems perform the following five basic functions for converting raw input data into useful information - inputting, storing, processing, outputting, and controlling.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part99.htm#bookmark955" class="s23">2. </a>Figure 4.1<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows the main components of a computer system.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <i>Input unit </i>enables feeding of data and instructions to a computer system from outside world in computer acceptable form.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <i>Input interfaces </i>transform input data and instructions (fed to a computer through its input devices) into binary codes that are acceptable to the computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <i>Output unit </i>enables a computer system to supply information (obtained from data processing) to outside world in human acceptable (readable) form.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <i>Output interfaces </i>transform information (obtained from data processing) from binary form to human acceptable (readable) form.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <i>Storage unit </i>of a computer system holds data and instructions to be processed and intermediate and output results of processing. Two types of storage are - primary and secondary storage. As compared to primary storage, secondary storage is slower in operation, larger in capacity, cheaper in price, and can retain information even when computer system switches off or resets.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">8. During data processing, execution of instructions takes place in <i>Arithmetic Logic Unit</i></p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(ALU) of a computer system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. <i>Control Unit </i>(CU) of a computer system manages and coordinates the operations of all other components of the computer system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">10. Control unit and arithmetic logic unit of a computer system together form the <i>Central Processing Unit </i>(CPU), which serves as the brain of the computer system and is responsible for controlling the operations of all other units of the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. We often refer to a computer as a <i>computer system </i>because it consists of integrated components (input unit, output unit, storage unit, and CPU) that work together to perform the steps called for in a program.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">12. <i>CPU </i>is the brain of a computer system. A computer performs all major calculations and comparisons inside its CPU. CPU is also responsible for activating and controlling the operations of other units of the computer system. Hence, no other single component of a computer determines its overall performance as much as its CPU.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">13. The two basic components of a CPU are control unit and arithmetic logic unit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">14. <i>Control Unit (CU) </i>of a computer&#39;s CPU acts as the central nervous system for all other components of the computer. It manages and coordinates the entire computer system including the input and output units. It obtains instructions from the program stored in main memory, interprets the instructions, and issues signals that cause other units of the system to execute them.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">15. <i>Arithmetic Logic Unit </i>(<i>ALU</i>) of a computer&#39;s CPU is the place where execution of instructions takes place during data processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">16. Every CPU has built-in ability to execute a set of machine instructions, called its</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">instruction set<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">17. As a computer&#39;s CPU interprets and executes instructions, there is movement of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">information between various units of the computer. To handle this process and to speed up the rate of information transfer, the CPU uses a number of special memory units called <i>registers </i>. These registers hold information on a temporary basis and are part of the CPU (not main memory).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">18. The speed of a processor depends on a computer&#39;s <i>clock speed, </i>which is the number of pulses produced per second by the built-in electronic clock. We measure clock speed in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">19. Normally, we measure the processing speed of personal computers in MHz or GHz; that of workstations, mini computers, and mainframe systems in MIPS (Millions of Instructions Per Second) or BIPS (Billions of Instructions Per Second); and that of supercomputers in MFLOPS (Millions of Floating Point Operations Per Second), GFLOPS (gigaflops, which refers to a billion FLOPS), TFLOPS (teraflops, which refers to 10<span class="s22">12 </span>FLOPS), or PFLOPS (petaflops, which refers to 10 <span class="s22">15 </span>FLOPS).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">20. Three commonly known processor architectures are CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer), RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer), and EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">21. CPUs with large instruction set, variable-length instructions, and a variety of addressing modes are called CPUs based on <i>CISC </i>(<i>Complex Instruction Set Computer</i>) <i>architecture</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">22. CPUs with a small instruction set, fixed-length instructions, and reduced references to memory to retrieve operands are called CPUs based on <i>RISC </i>(<i>Reduced Instruction Set Computer</i>) <i>architecture</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">23. <i>Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing </i>(<i>EPIC</i>) architecture uses three key techniques for improved performance. They are explicit parallelism, predication, and speculation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">24. Multicore processor technology enables building of computers with better overall system performance by handling more work in parallel. In this technology, a processor chip has multiple  cooler-running,  more  energy-efficient  processing  cores  instead  of  one increasingly powerful core. A multicore chip can run multiple programs/threads at the same time with each core handling a separate program/thread. To take advantage of multicore chips, we must redesign applications so that the processor can run them as multiple threads.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">25. Considering total cost of ownership (TCO), a new measure that has become popular for measuring the performance of computing systems is power consumption to processing power ratio. Processors that reduce power consumption right at processor level are known as <i>power-efficient processors</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">26. <i>Demand Based Switching (DBS) </i>is a technology used in power-efficient processors for reduced power consumption.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">27. Instructions and data of a program reside in a temporary storage area mainly when the CPU is executing the program. This storage space is known as <i>primary storage</i>, <i>main memory</i>, or simply <i>memory</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">28. A storage unit of a computer system is characterized and evaluated based on following properties - storage capacity, access time, cost per bit of storage, volatile, and random access.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">29. Main memory of a computer system consists of several small storage areas called</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">locations <span class="p">or </span>cells<span class="p">. Each location can store a fixed number of bits, called </span>word length <span class="p">of the memory. Each location has a unique address, which remains the same regardless of its contents. The first address starts at 0 and the highest address equals the number of words that can be stored in the memory minus 1.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">30. Data and instructions move to and from memory as one or more words at a time. Therefore, even if the electronic circuits used are comparable in speed, computers having smaller word length will be slower in operation than computers having larger word length.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">31. In a word-addressable computer, each numbered address location can store a fixed number of characters (equal to its word-length in bytes). These computers allocate storage space in multiples of word-length. On the other hand, in a character-addressable computer, each numbered address can store only a single character (A, B, 1, 2, +, -, etc.).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">32. Main memory capacity of a computer is the number of bytes that its main memory can store. Normally, we measure main memory capacity in terms of <i>kilobytes </i>(<i>KB</i>), which is equal to 1024 (2 <span class="s22">10</span>) bytes of storage, <i>megabytes </i>(<i>MB</i>), which is equal to 1,048,576 (2<span class="s22">20</span>) bytes of storage, or<i>gigabytes </i>(<i>GB</i>), which is equal to 1,073,741,824 (2 <span class="s22">30</span>) bytes of storage.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">33. A computer&#39;s main memory uses volatile RAM chips. RAM chips are of two types - dynamic and static. <i>Dynamic RAM </i>(<i>DRAM</i>), uses an external circuitry to periodically “regenerate” or refresh storage charge to retain the stored data, while <i>static RAM </i>( <i>SRAM</i>), does not need any special regenerator circuit to retain the stored data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">34. A special type of RAM, called <i>read-only memory </i>( <i>ROM</i>), is a non-volatile memory chip in which data is stored permanently. Usual programs cannot alter this data. There are two types of read-only memory (ROM) - manufacturer-programmed and user-programmed. The latter is known as <i>Programmable Read-Only Memory </i>(<i>PROM</i>) because a user can program it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">35. Once information is stored in a ROM or PROM chip, a user cannot alter it. <i>Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory </i>(<i>EPROM</i>) chip overcomes this problem by allowing users to reprogram it to store new information. EPROM chips are of two types - <i>Ultra Violet EPROM </i>(<i>UVEPROM</i>) and<i>Electrically EPROM </i>(<i>EEPROM</i>). EEPROM is also known as <i>flash memory</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">36. We can improve overall system performance by minimizing memory-processor speed mismatch. Two approaches used commonly for doing this are use of cache memory and memory interleaving.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">37. <i>Cache memory </i>is an extremely fast, small memory between the CPU and main memory whose access time is closer to the processing speed of CPU. It acts as a high-speed buffer between CPU and main memory and computer systems use it to temporarily store active data and instructions during processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">38. The connectivity channel used for interaction between the CPU and memory is known as a <i>bus</i>. Physically, a bus is a set of wires, which carries a group of bits in parallel and has an associated control scheme. Width of a bus is the number of parallel lines (wires) in the bus. Every computer system has following three types of buses - <i>data bus</i>, <i>address bus, </i>and <i>control bus</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">39. Every computer system also uses buses for interconnecting the CPU with I/O devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Computer systems use the same three types of buses (data bus, address bus, and control bus) for interconnecting the CPU with I/O devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">40. <i>Interconnection architecture </i>of a computer system defines the manner in which its CPU, memory, and I/O devices are connected to each other. Accessing mechanism and flow of data from one unit to another depends on interconnection architecture. The three commonly  used  interconnection  architectures  are  <i>unibus  architecture</i>,<i>dual  bus architecture, </i>and <i>DMA </i>( <i>Direct Memory Access</i>) <i>architecture</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">41. Multiprocessor systems consist of multiple processors (CPUs). They are broadly classified as shared memory systems (also called <i>tightly-coupled systems</i>) and distributed memory systems (also called <i>loosely-coupled systems</i>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">42. A <i>shared memory system </i>uses a single system-wide primary memory, which all its processors share.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">43. A <i>distributed memory system </i>consists of multiple computers interconnected together by a communication network. Hence, they are also known as <i>multicomputer systems</i>. Each individual computer can itself be a multiprocessor system (a shared memory system). As interconnected computers do not share a common memory (each one has its own local memory), all physical communication between them takes place by passing messages across the communication network that interconnects them. Hence, these systems are also known as <i>message-passing systems</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">44. A <i>parallel processing system </i>is a multiprocessor system, which treats a large number of processors as a pool and shares them among users as needed. It processes a job much faster by making multiple processors process different parts of the job in parallel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part127.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part129.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
