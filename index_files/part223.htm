In a project of reasonable size and complexity, it is impossible to perfect one phase of software development before moving on to the next phase.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Often, clients are not clear about their requirements in the beginning. They are able to articulate and define their requirements only when they see a working prototype of the system they desire. Hence, following the phases sequentially (as required in the waterfall model) may not be possible in such cases.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Often, clients keep changing their requirements constantly, and software development team has to accommodate several (if not all) of these proposed changes. If clients propose such changes during the implementation phase (after completion of system design), the team must revisit the requirement specification as well as system analysis and design phases to accommodate the new requirements, invalidating some of the original specifications and system design. Hence, following the phases sequentially (as required in the waterfall model) may not be possible in such cases.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Often, designers are not aware of future implementation problems when designing and preparing the architecture of unimplemented software. The team may realize only during the implementation phase that certain aspect of the design is difficult to implement, and hence, it should modify the design. A purely sequential approach (like the waterfall model) is not suitable for taking care of such requirements.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Often, developers discover many of the system&#39;s details/problems as they progress from one phase to another. Some of the details/problems that they discover at certain points require the developers to backtrack into earlier phases to accommodate the discovered details or to correct the discovered problems. A purely sequential approach (like the waterfall model) is not suitable for taking care of such requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part222.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part224.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
