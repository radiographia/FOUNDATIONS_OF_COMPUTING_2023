In this two-tier system architecture, one or more server computers served several client computers connected to them. This architecture</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">was inflexible and had its own limitations due to the following reasons:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Programmers had to include the code for management and support services (such as directories for locating resources, authentication for handling security, exception management for handling failures, and co-scheduling of networked resources for better performance) within the client and server parts of the application software.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Programmers had to synchronize client and server processes for exchange of messages between them (they used synchronous mode of communication rather than asynchronous mode, which is more flexible).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Programmers had to include the code for business application logic inside the user interface on the client, or within the application software on the server, or both.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="375" height="592" alt="image" src="Image_440.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1409">Figure. 7.2. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating the use and location of middleware.</span><a name="bookmark1410">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As a result, there was close knitting between client and server systems, making independent development of interoperable client and server software difficult. Hence, rapid development and deployment, ease of management, and portability of distributed applications were difficult.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part215.htm#bookmark1409" class="s23">Distributed application developers invented the three-tier system architecture [shown in </a><a href="part215.htm#bookmark1409" class="s3">Figure</a><a href="part215.htm#bookmark1409" class="s24"> </a><a href="part215.htm#bookmark1409" class="s3">7.2</a><a href="part215.htm#bookmark1409" class="s23">(b)] to overcome these problems. The basic idea here was to have a separate software </a>layer, which acts as “glue” between the client and server parts of an application. It provides a programming abstraction that masks the heterogeneity of underlying network, hardware, and operating systems from application programmers. This software layer is known as <i>middleware </i>because it sits in the middle, between the operating system and applications. In general, <i>middleware </i>is a set of tools and data that help applications use networked resources and services.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part214.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part216.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
