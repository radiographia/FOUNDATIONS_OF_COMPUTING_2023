However, backup and archiving are two different processes, involving different capabilities. Having an understanding of both these processes and associated challenges helps an organization to develop the foundation for an intelligent and robust storage solution. The two concepts have the following basic differences:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Backup deals with active data, whereas archiving deals with inactive data. A system accesses <i>active data </i>frequently, whereas it accesses <i>inactive data </i>occasionally. Hence, it is less likely for a system to access inactive data. Reasons for maintaining inactive data might be to comply with corporate and government regulations on data authenticity, to perform trend analysis in future, or to maintain a history of customers or transactions.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. The goal of backup is active data security through redundancy on backup storage, whereas the goal of archiving is inactive data retention through its movement to archival storage.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1197">3. Backup creates secondary copy of active primary information on backup storage, whereas archiving moves inactive primary information to archival storage.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Backup provides short-term protection of active data to ensure business continuity in case of failures, whereas archiving provides long-term retention of inactive data for future reference.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. In most cases, a system retains backup data only for a few days or weeks, as new backup data supersedes previous versions. On the other hand, a system retains archived data for several years and data archived periodically does not supersede previously archived data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. A system generates backup data in a periodic automated fashion, and systematically overwrites it. On the other hand, archived data is in its final form, and does not undergo any modification.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. Normally, a system architect chooses backup storage media to enable modification by overwriting on previous version, whereas he/she chooses archiving storage media to prevent modification (WORM) of archived data because data authenticity is the key to archiving.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. Backup requires ease of restoring lost data from backup storage in case of failures. Hence, easy access to all data is crucial. On the other hand, archiving requires access and retrieval of a specific piece of information rather than access to all data. Hence, organization of backup and archival data is done differently.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part176.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part178.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
