For example, shouting to another person involves voice transmission on the medium air that carries voice as sound waves. Telephone lines (as a transmission medium) enhance possible communication distance considerably. Like telephone lines, there are several types of physical channels (communication media) used for data transmission from one point to another. Some popular ones are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Twisted-Pair Wire</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part437.htm#bookmark2178" class="s23">A twisted-pair wire consists of two bunches of thin copper wires, each bunch enclosed separately in a plastic insulation, then twisted around each other to reduce interference by adjacent wires (see </a><a href="part437.htm#bookmark2178" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">12.3</span>). It is also called <i>unshielded twisted-pair </i>(UTP) cable because other than the plastic insulation around the two individual bunches of copper wires, nothing else shields it from outside interference.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">UTP cables are commonly used in local telephone communication and short distance (up to about 1 km) digital data transmission. Normally, they are used to connect terminals to main computer, if they are placed at a short distance apart. For distance up to 100 meters, they provide data transmission speed of up to 9600 bps, and for longer distances (such as in local telephone lines), they provide speed of the order of 1200 bps.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">UTP cables are inexpensive, and easy to install and use. However, their use is limited because they easily pick up noise signals (resulting in high error rates) when line length extends beyond 100 meters.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 155pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="226" height="14" alt="image" src="Image_702.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2178">Figure 12.3. </a><span class="s21">A twisted-pair wire (UTP cable).</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Coaxial Cable</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part437.htm#bookmark2179" class="s23">Coaxial cables consist of a central copper wire surrounded by a PVC insulation over which there is a sleeve of copper mesh (see </a><a href="part437.htm#bookmark2179" class="s3">Figure </a>12.4<span class="p">). The copper mesh sleeve is shielded again by an outer shield of thick PVC material. Signal is transmitted by inner copper wire, and is electrically shielded by the outer copper mesh sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 160pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="213" height="108" alt="image" src="Image_703.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2179">Figure 12.4. </a><span class="s21">A coaxial cable.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Coaxial cables offer much higher bandwidths than UTP cables, and can transmit digital signals at rates up to 10 mega bps. They are extensively used in long distance telephone lines for both voice and data transmission. Telephone companies often package several coaxial cables into a large cable, which can handle over 40,000 telephone calls simultaneously. Furthermore, coaxial cables have much higher noise immunity, and can offer cleaner and crisper data transmission without distortion or loss of signal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Microwave System</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2180">Microwave systems use high frequency radio signals to transmit data through space (wireless communication). However, at microwave frequencies, electromagnetic waves cannot bend or pass obstacles like tall buildings or hills. Hence, the transmitter and receiver of a microwave system, mounted on high towers, should be in line-of-sight. This may not be possible for long distance transmission. Moreover, signals become weaker after traveling a certain distance and require power amplification.</a></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part437.htm#bookmark2181" class="s23">To overcome the problems of line-of-sight and power amplification of weak signals, microwave systems use repeaters at intervals of about 25 to 30 kms in between the transmitting and receiving stations (see </a><a href="part437.htm#bookmark2181" class="s3">Figure </a>12.5<span class="p">). A microwave communication system places its first repeater in line-of-sight of the transmitting station and its last repeater in line-of-sight of the receiving station. It also places any two consecutive repeaters in line-of-sight of each other. Each of these stations receives, amplifies, and retransmits data signals.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="367" height="171" alt="image" src="Image_704.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2181">Figure 12.5. </a><span class="s21">A microwave communication system.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Microwave systems have speed of about 16 Giga bps (1 Giga = 10 <span class="s22">9</span>). They can support about 250,000 voice channels simultaneously. As they support wireless communication, they do not require laying of cables and associated cost of land digging. However, since their initial installation cost is high, they are cost effective only for communication systems that link big cities with heavy telephone/data traffic between them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Communications Satellite</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The main problem with microwave communication is that the curvature of the earth, mountains, and other structures often block the line-of-sight. Hence, long distance transmission requires several repeater stations, increasing data transmission cost between two points. Satellites overcome this problem.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Communication satellites are microwave relay stations in outer space. A space shuttle launches a satellite and places it in outer space precisely 36,000 kms above the equator with an orbit speed that exactly matches the earth&#39;s rotation speed. Being in geosynchronous orbit, a satellite is stationary relative to the earth, and always stays over the same point on the ground. This allows a ground station to aim its antenna at a fixed point in the sky. Each satellite can receive and retransmit signals to slightly less than half the earth&#39;s surface because the earth is round. Therefore, to provide data transmission service worldwide, there should be at least three satellites in geosynchronous orbit. Hundreds of satellites are now in orbit to handle international and domestic data, voice, and video communications needs. The positions of INSAT series of Indian satellites in outer space are such that they enable communication between any two locations in India.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In satellite communication, microwave signal at 6 GHz or 14 GHz (GHz is read as gigahertz, and 1 GHz = 10<span class="s22">9 </span><a href="part437.htm#bookmark2183" class="s23">Hz) is transmitted from a transmitter on earth to a satellite positioned in space (see </a><a href="part437.htm#bookmark2183" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">12.6</span>). By the time this signal reaches the satellite, it becomes weak due to 36,000 kms travel. A transponder, mounted on the satellite, amplifies the weak signal and transmits it back to the earth at a frequency of 4 GHz or 11 GHz. A receiving station on the earth receives this signal. Note that retransmission frequency is different from transmission frequency to avoid interference of powerful retransmission signal with weak incoming signal.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A transponder can typically support 1200 voice channels each of 4800 bps, or 400 digital channels each of 64 Kbps (Kilo bits per second). A satellite has many transponders. Therefore, a single satellite has enormous data communication capability.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2182">Use of 4 GHz to 6 GHz band of frequencies for transmission and retransmission of microwave signals in a satellite communication system is called </a><i>C-band transmission</i>, and use of 11 GHz to 14 GHz band of frequencies is called <i>Ku-band transmission</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To enable a large number of users to benefit from satellite communication, communication service providers realized that they need to considerably reduce the size and cost of receive- transmit earth stations, so that a user can easily install a private earth station. Hence, they built smaller dish antennas, having lower power transmitters and receivers, for installation at users&#39; sites. These dish antenna systems are known as <i>VSATs </i>( <i>Very Small Aperture Terminals</i>). Aperture refers to the diameter of dish antenna (about 1 to 2 meters).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Satellite communication systems have the following advantages:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">1. A satellite is essentially a microwave relay station visible from any point in a large area. Hence, it enables data transmission between any two randomly chosen points in that area.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">2. Data transmission costs are independent of the distance between any two points as long as these two points are within the satellite&#39;s area coverage.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. A satellite having many transponders has enormous data communication capability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="476" height="190" alt="image" src="Image_705.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 159pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2183">Figure 12.6. </a><span class="s21">A satellite communication system.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Error detection is trivial because a transmitting station can receive back its own transmission and check whether the satellite has transmitted the data correctly. If not, it can retransmit the data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Due to wireless communication, they do not require laying of cables and associated cost of land digging.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A satellite communication system, however, suffers from the following disadvantages:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. Initial cost of placing a satellite into its orbit is quite high.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Microwave signal has to travel a long distance from transmitting earth station to satellite and then back to receiving earth station. This causes data propagation delay of about 270 msec between the sender and receiver.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Whatever data a satellite receives for transmission, it broadcasts it to all receiving stations within the satellite&#39;s coverage area. Hence, satellite-based communication systems need special security measures to prevent unauthorized access of information.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Atmospheric disturbances, like thunder and lightening, affect Ku-band transmission of a satellite communication system. Hence, the communication system must use C-band transmission during bad weather.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2184">Optical Fibers</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Optical fibers are hair-thin threads of glass or plastic used as data transmission medium like copper wires or coaxial cables. However, unlike copper wires or coaxial cables, they transmit light signals instead of electrical signals. As light travels much faster than electricity, optical fibers can transmit data at much higher speed than copper wires or coaxial cables, with no significant loss of intensity over long distances.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Optical fibers are made of glass, plastic, or silica. Plastic fibers are least efficient, but are cheaper</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and more rugged. Glass or silica fibers are much smaller, and their lower attenuation makes them more suitable for high capacity channels.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Physically, a fiber-optic cable consists of three concentric layers - inner core, a cladding around it, and outer protective coating. Inner core has a diameter of 8 to 200 micrometers and consists of a bunch of optical fibers. The cladding around it is made of plastic or glass, and has a refractive index less than that of the core. The characteristics of light propagation depend primarily on fiber size, its construction, refractive index profile, and nature of light source. The outer protective coating is made of plastic.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part437.htm#bookmark2185" class="s3">Figure </a>12.7<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows the main components of an optical fiber communication system. The sender side electrical-to-light-wave converter converts electrical signals into light signals. It uses either a light-emitting diode (LED) or a laser diode to convert electric signals into light signals. It then transmits these light waves over the optical fiber to receiver&#39;s end. The receiver side light-to- electrical-wave converter detects the light waves and converts them back to electrical signals. It uses photoelectric diodes for this purpose. An amplifier then amplifies and sends the electrical signals to the receiver.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="73" alt="image" src="Image_706.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2185">Figure 12.7. </a><span class="s21">An optical fiber communication system.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Optical fibers have the following advantages:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Large bandwidth. </b>Optical fibers can transmit large volumes of data at high speed and long distances. They can have 10 to 100 times greater bandwidth than the best coaxial cables depending on the number of fibers bunched in inner core. A fiber-optic cable consisting of a bunch of 10 optical fibers can support more than 200,000 voice channels.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Low loss. </b>Light signals can travel at much higher speed than electrical signals with no significant loss of intensity over long distances. Hence, any data communication system using electrical signals (such as copper wires or coaxial cables) requires repeaters at short intervals along the way to intercept and amplify electrical signals. Light signals also need amplification, but at much longer intervals than that of electrical signals. Hence, an optical fiber communication system does not require signal repeaters at short intervals, resulting in reduced cost.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Immunity to electromagnetic interference. </b>Optical fibers are made of glass/plastic. Hence, magnetic or electrical interference, which causes errors in other media (especially in twisted-pair wire) does not affect optical fiber transmissions. Consequently, optical fiber communication systems do not require complex error checking and correction mechanisms, which other media that are sensitive of electromagnetic interference require. This reduces the design cost and overhead associated with error checking and correction.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Small size and lightweight. </b>Fiber optic cables are much smaller and lighter than copper wires or coaxial cables. For example, a fiber optic cable with a core and cladding of 0.125 mm diameter and 3.5 mm outer protective coating has the same data transmission capacity as 900 twisted copper wire pairs with an 8 cm outer diameter and weighing 100 times</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2186">more. Size and weight are important factors when considering conduits running under overcrowded city streets. In some large cities, there is no room for additional bulky copper wires. In this case, use of smaller and lighter fiber optic cables is effective.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Security. </b>Optical fiber offers increased security against unauthorized tampering of information, since it is extremely difficult and expensive to tap optical signals.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Safety and electrical insulation. </b>Optical fibers, being insulators, provide electrical isolation between the source and destination. Hence, they are free from hazards due to electrical spark and are safe to use in places where it is unsafe to use electrical conductors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Analog and digital signals transmission. </b>Optical fibers enable transmission of both analog and digital signals. An analog transmission system continuously varies light intensity, whereas a digital transmission system turns light source on and off.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Optical fibers, however, suffer from the following disadvantages:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Optical fibers, being fragile, cannot turn at sharp corners. They can turn at corners having radius of at least a few inches. This creates problem in physical laying of fiber optic cables.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Aligning and joining two fiber optic cables is not as easy as for twisted copper wire pairs or coaxial cables. It requires special equipment to do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because of its advantages, optical fibers are widely used now for many applications involving telephones, televisions, and computers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part436.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part438.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
