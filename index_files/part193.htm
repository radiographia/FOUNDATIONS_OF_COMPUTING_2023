A VDT (often referred to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">as just <i>terminal</i>) is both an input and output device. A user uses the keyboard to input data to a computer and the monitor to view the output from the computer.

As compared to CRT monitors, LCD flat-panel monitors are thinner, lighter, and are suitable for use with both portable and non-portable computer systems. Users prefer them because they occupy less table space and consume less power.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How a CRT Monitor Displays an Output?</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part193.htm#bookmark1278" class="s23">A CRT monitor is a glass tube with a screen at one end and an electron gun at the other end. </a><a href="part193.htm#bookmark1278" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.20</span> shows its major components. The electron beam generator has an oxide-coated metal (called <i>cathode</i>) and a heating filament. The cathode emits a large number of electrons when heated by the filament. In front of the electron beam generator is a control grid applied with an appropriate positive voltage. It allows the exact number of electrons, out of the generated ones, to pass through it for striking at the monitor&#39;s screen. Larger is the positive voltage applied to the control grid, larger is the number of electrons that pass the control grid and strike the screen, and larger is the beam&#39;s intensity. If the grid voltage is negative, no electrons pass the control grid and the beam is “blanked”.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An assembly unit consisting of accelerating electrodes and a focusing electron lens accelerates and focuses the electrons, which pass through the control grid. The unit applies a positive voltage to accelerating electrodes to accelerate the electrons. The focusing electron lens consists of a cylindrical metal enclosure with a hole through which the electrons pass in the form of an electron beam. The <i>electron gun </i>of the CRT monitor includes the electron beam generator, control grid, accelerating electrodes, and focusing electron lens.</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="391" height="183" alt="image" src="Image_408.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1278">Figure 6.20. </a><span class="s21">Major components of a CRT monitor.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The electron beam generated by the electron gun passes through a pair of vertical deflection plates and a pair of horizontal deflection plates. It applies appropriate positive voltages to one of the vertical plates and one of the horizontal plates to focus the beam at a desired point on the screen. For example, the display mechanism applies a suitable positive voltage to the top/bottom vertical plate to move the beam up/down, and to the left/right horizontal plate to move the beam left/right. Thus, the electron beam hits at the desired point on the screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The backside of the screen has phosphor coating, a chemical that glows for a short time when hit by the electron beam. The screen&#39;s phosphor coating is in the form of a grid of dots called <i>pixels </i>(a contraction of picture elements). Since phosphor glows only for a short time (few microseconds), an image drawn on the screen would be visible only for a few microseconds and then would fade away, unless the display mechanism draws the image repeatedly. This may appear to be an inconvenience, but it is also an advantage since there is no need to erase anything. The display mechanism just draws new images and the old ones fade away automatically.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part193.htm#bookmark1280" class="s23" name="bookmark1279">The electron gun does not draw an image directly by focusing and shooting on the pixels forming the image. Instead, it traverses the screen in a fixed pattern (see </a><a href="part193.htm#bookmark1280" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.21</span>). That is, it aims at every pixel on the screen systematically, starting at the top-left corner and scanning to the right horizontally, then dropping down a small distance and scanning another line. Each horizontal line of pixels is called a <i>scan line</i>. Each scan line has a fixed number of pixels, and the electron gun can write or not write a pixel in each position by turning the beam on or off. When the beam reaches the right end of a scan line, the device turns it off and moves it to the starting point of the next scan line. This is called <i>horizontal trace </i>. After scanning all scan lines, when the beam reaches the right end of the bottom-most scan line, the device turns it off and moves it to the starting point of the top-most scan line. This is called <i>vertical trace</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 127pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="302" height="177" alt="image" src="Image_409.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1280">Figure 6.21. </a><span class="s21">Scanning of a monitor&#39;s screen by its electron beam.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In one pass of scanning the entire screen, if the electron beam travels all scan lines from top to bottom sequentially, it is called a <i>progressive scan </i><a href="part193.htm#bookmark1280" class="s23">(see </a><a href="part193.htm#bookmark1280" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.21</span> (a)). On the other hand, if the electron beam travels only odd numbered scan lines in one pass and even numbered scan lines in the next pass, it is called an <i>interlaced scan </i><a href="part193.htm#bookmark1280" class="s23">(see </a><a href="part193.htm#bookmark1280" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.21</span> (b)). In case of interlaced scan, since the monitor scans every other line instead of each line in order, it has to transmit only half as much data in a single pass, but takes two passes to draw the entire screen. Interlaced scan may cause flicker of images drawn on the screen. Hence, low quality monitors use interlaced scan and high quality monitors use progressive scan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How to Compare CRT Monitors</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We often use the following attributes to compare CRT monitors:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Screen size. </b>Display screens of monitors vary in size from 5 to 25 inches (diagonal dimension). Monitors with 17-inch to 21-inch screen size are common with personal and desktop computers. Although, monitors with larger screen are costlier, users prefer them because they enable viewing of multiple windows, video clips, animated objects, and complex graphics.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Resolution. </b>Resolution refers to the number of points to which the electron beam can be directed (pixels) on the screen. As the pixels are arranged in scan lines, resolution of a monitor depends on its total number of scan lines and total number of pixels per scan line (each scan line has same number of pixels). Total number of scan lines is called a monitor&#39;s <i>vertical resolution </i>and total number of pixels per scan line is called its <i>horizontal resolution</i>. Overall resolution of a monitor is a multiple of its horizontal and vertical resolutions. A low-resolution monitor has a resolution of about 320 × 200, while high-end monitors have resolutions of 1024 × 768, 1280 × 1024, or more. The higher the resolution of a monitor, the sharper is its displayed images.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Refresh rate. </b>Since a pixel on phosphor-coated screen glows for a short time only (few microseconds) and then fades away, the display mechanism redraws an image 30 to 60 times a second to make it appear flicker-free. Hence, the electron beam should scan the entire screen 30 to 60 times a second. The actual number of times that the electron beam scans the entire screen per second is called <i>refresh rate </i>of the monitor. The higher the refresh rate, the better is the display quality. Today, most monitors operate at 60 Hz, refreshing the screen 60 times per second. Better quality monitors operate at 70 to 90 Hz.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Color. </b>Monitors are either monochrome or color. A color monitor displays multi-colored images, while a monochrome monitor displays images only in a single color, usually white, red, green, blue, or amber. Although a monochrome monitor displays only a single color, it is usually capable of displaying multiple shades (increased and reduced color intensities) of the same color. The term <i>gray scales </i>is used to refer to the number of shades of a color that a monitor can display. Monochrome monitors have become obsolete, as most applications today require color monitors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1281">To add color, a color monitor uses three electron beams instead of one, and each pixel on screen consists of three tiny red, green, and blue phosphors arranged in the shape of a triangle. When the device combines three electron beams and focuses the combined beam on a pixel, phosphors of that pixel light up to form a tiny spot of white light. The device displays different colors by combining various intensities of the three beams. Color monitors are also called </a><i>RGB monitors </i>because they use red, green, and blue as primary additive colors for generating multiple colors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Color monitors use multiple bits to represent each pixel. For example, if display mechanism represents each pixel by one byte (8 bits), it can indicate one of 2<span class="s22">8 </span>= 256 different colors to draw the pixels. That is, the monitor supports 256 different colors. There are millions of colors when we consider all shades and mixtures of color possible, for which 256 is far too few colors. High- end monitors use 24 bits to represent each pixel. Such monitors can support 2<span class="s22">24 </span>or about 16 million different colors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Based on the resolution and number of colors supported, several standards for color monitors have evolved. We can implement a standard by installing an add-on board (commonly known as a <i>graphics adapter board </i>or a <i>video card</i>) in the main computer box and connecting it to the monitor. The four popular standards are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">a. <i>CGA (Color Graphics Adapter). </i>It has a low resolution of 320 × 200 and supports up to 16 colors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">b. <i>EGA (Extended Graphics Adapter</i>)<i>. </i>It has a resolution of 640 × 350 and supports up to 16 colors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">c. <i>VGA (Video Graphics Array). </i>It has a resolution of 640 × 480 and supports up to 256 colors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">d. <i>Super VGA. </i>It provides resolution from 800 × 600 to 1280 × 1024 and supports 256 or more colors.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All modern personal computers come with at least VGA output.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part193.htm#bookmark1282" class="s23">A video card (graphics adaptor card) has its own memory called video RAM.

It is most suitable for use with portable computer systems, such as a laptop, because such systems must be compact in size, light in weight, and should consume less power.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1283">The  display  technologies  used  by  flat  panel  monitors  include</a><i>liquid-crystal  display </i>(LCD),<i>electro-luminescent display </i>(ELD), and <i>gas-plasma display </i>(GPD). Out of these, LCD monitors are in most common use. As the name implies, LCD monitors use a special kind of liquid crystals to display images on the screen. The liquid crystals used in these monitors are normally transparent, but become opaque when charged with electricity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 141pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="265" height="134" alt="image" src="Image_411.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1284">Figure 6.23. </a><span class="s21">A notebook computer with a flat panel monitor.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Liquid crystals do not glow when charged, so there is not enough contrast between the images displayed and their background to make them clearly legible under all lighting conditions. Hence, LCD monitors use a light source behind the screen to make the screen easier to read.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dumb, Smart, and Intelligent Terminals</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Depending on their local processing capability, we classify terminals (monitors along with keyboards) as dumb, smart, and intelligent.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A <i>dumb terminal </i>is a low-cost terminal, without any local processing capability. It transmits all input data as received to the computer. This type of data is called “dirty” data because it contains errors along with good data. The computer identifies errors and informs the terminal operator. In this process, processing based on input data is delayed until “clean” data is obtained from the operator. This delay, accompanied by the need to process the data again, can be expensive.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A <i>smart terminal </i>has a microprocessor (a CPU) and some internal storage in addition to I/O capabilities. It has local data editing capability and the ability to consolidate input data prior to sending it to the computer. Preliminary processing of input data takes place locally, and the terminal cleans up the data before transmitting it to the main computer for processing. This saves clean data preparation time as compared to dumb terminals. However, users cannot program smart terminals.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An <i>intelligent terminal </i>is a small computer by itself. It consists of a built-in microcomputer and users can program it. These programmable terminals have extensive local data processing capability. They can maintain large working files locally and can handle small data processing jobs, without the need to interact with the main computer. They have their own secondary storage devices like disk, which they use during processing of these small jobs. Programmed error-detection tests can also be stored in the terminal for validation of input data, which can ensure transmission of clean data to the main computer system for further processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Most terminals used today are intelligent or at least smart.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Terminal Emulators</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Computers are often connected to networks and communicate with other computers on the network. In this case, computers interact with each other in client-server mode and may keep changing their roles of client and server at different occasions. In such a situation, a full-fledged computer like a PC or a workstation is required to serve as a terminal for communicating with a remote computer. However, a PC or a workstation is not a terminal, and does not act like a terminal. A simple way to solve this problem is to write a software program that runs on the PC or workstation, communicates with the network interface over a serial port on the PC or workstation, and pretends that it is a terminal. Such a program is called <i>terminal emulator</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1285">Privacy Filters</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Often users work in an open area with sensitive information displayed on their monitors, and have the fear of their co-workers around them viewing the displayed information. A privacy filter, which fits over a monitor&#39;s screen, hides the displayed contents from prying eyes. It is made of a plastic film that is inlaid with microscopic black strips. A user sitting in front of the screen can see through the filter clearly, but the screen looks black to others standing/sitting nearby on either side.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part192.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part194.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
