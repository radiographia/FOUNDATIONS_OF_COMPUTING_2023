The following factors generally influence the selection process:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Nature of the application. </b>A programmer should select a language that is suitable for the application domain at hand. For example, FORTRAN is suitable for scientific and engineering applications, while COBOL is suitable for business applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Familiarity with the language. </b>If he/she finds that multiple languages are suitable for the application domain, he/she should select the one with which he/she and other programmers in his/her team (who will code the application) are most familiar.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1778">3. </a><b>Ease of learning the language. </b>If he/she finds that multiple languages are suitable for the application domain, and the programmers are not familiar with any of them, he/she should select the language that is easy to learn and use.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Availability  of  program  development  tools.  </b>Before  selecting  a  language,  the programmer must also find out if the programming environment of the language has good program development tools like compiler, interpreter, debugger, linker, etc. A language with a good set of program development tools can significantly reduce the time and effort of the team of programmers involved in coding an application.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Execution efficiency. </b>If the execution efficiency of an application is important, the programmers can use an assembly language instead of a high-level language for coding the application. This is because an assembly language program written by a clever programmer usually has a shorter production run time, and takes less storage space than does a program written for the same application in a high-level language.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Features of a good programming language. </b>Finally, the features of a good programming language discussed in the previous section often influence the selection process.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part330.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part332.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
