They come in various sizes ranging from 12.0-inch to 3.0-inch diameter. The most popular one is of 5.25-inch diameter with capacity of about 650 Megabytes, which is equivalent to about 2,50,000 pages of printed text. Optical disks are the most suitable storage media for multimedia applications because of their large storage capacity.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As optical disks have a single track,</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Storage capacity of an optical disk = Number of sectors <span class="p">´ </span>Number of bytes per sector</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The 5.25-inch optical disk typically has 3,30,000 sectors each of 2352 bytes, making its storage capacity equal to 3,30,000 ´ 2352 = 776 ´ 10 <span class="s22">6 </span>bytes = 776 Megabytes.

It has two laser beam sources. It uses one laser beam (of greater intensity) to write data by etching microscopic pits on the disk surface and another laser beam (of lesser intensity) to read data from the light-sensitive disk surface. To write data, it turns the laser beam ON and OFF at a varying rate due to which tiny pits (visible only through a powerful microscope) are burnt into the metal coating of disk surface along its tracks. To read data, it focuses the less- powerful laser beam on the disk surface. This beam is strongly reflected by the coated surface (known as a </a><i>land</i>) and weakly reflected by the burnt surface (known as a <i>pit</i><a href="part143.htm#bookmark1132" class="s23">), producing patterns of ON and OFF reflections, which are converted into electronic signals of binary 1s and 0s by a sensor (see </a><a href="part143.htm#bookmark1132" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">5.21</span>). It uses a mechanical forward-backward moving read/write access arm with laser source and detection lens (called <i>eye</i>) assembly to place the unit at the desired place on</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the optical disk. This assembly and the disk do not come in contact. The disk itself is on a spindle attached to a motor that rotates the disk during access.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="426" height="184" alt="image" src="Image_362.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1132">Figure 5.21. </a><span class="s21">Surface of an optical disk consists of tiny lands and pits. The laser beam is strongly reflected by lands and weakly reflected (scattered) by pits, producing patterns of ON and OFF reflections, which are converted into electronic signals of binary 1s and 0s by a sensor.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Optical Disk Drive</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part143.htm#bookmark1133" class="s23">A user mounts an optical disk on an optical disk drive for reading/writing of information from/to it. An optical disk drive contains all the mechanical, electrical, and electronic components for holding an optical disk and for reading/writing of data from/to it. It contains a tray on which the disk is kept, read/write laser beams assembly, and motor to rotate the disk. </a><a href="part143.htm#bookmark1133" class="s3">Figure </a>5.22<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows an optical disk drive.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An optical disk drive differs from a magnetic disk drive in the following manner:</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part143.htm#bookmark1133" class="s23">1. As </a>Figure 5.22<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows, it uses laser beam technology for data reading/writing and has no mechanical read/write access arm.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Magnetic disk drives use a constant angular velocity (CAV) encoding scheme, whereas optical disk drives use a constant linear velocity (CLV) encoding scheme. That is, in case of magnetic disk drives, the disk spins at a constant rate of speed and each sector occupies the area subtended by a fixed angle. On the other hand, in case of optical disk drives, the rotational speed of the disk varies inversely with the radius; the motor slows down the disk to read sectors towards the periphery of the disk and speeds it up to read sectors towards the center of the disk. Doing this requires a more complicated drive mechanism that can overcome the inertia of the disk when accelerating and the momentum when decelerating, which slows the drive&#39;s random access time. However, this encoding scheme enables data packing at maximum density over the entire disk.</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="455" height="165" alt="image" src="Image_363.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1133">Figure 5.22. </a><span class="s21">An optical disk drive and disk.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1134">Access Time</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Optical disk drives are slower (have larger access time) than magnetic disk drives due to the following reasons:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Sectors of an optical disk are on a continuous spiral track. This data organization results in slower random access of a sector than in case of concentric tracks organization (used by magnetic disks) because in case of concentric tracks, data access mechanism always finds sectors on a given track at a fixed distance from the center.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. In case of optical disks, each sector has the same length regardless of its position from the center. This data organization requires a more complicated drive mechanism because disk&#39;s rotation speed must vary inversely with the radius. That is, the drive must slow down disk&#39;s rotation speed to read/write sectors towards the periphery of the disk and speed it up to read/write sectors towards the center of the disk. This access mechanism leads to slower data access (larger access time) as compared to magnetic disks in which case the disks rotate at a constant speed irrespective of the location of accessed data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Since optical disk is a removable media, it is prone to scratches, dust, sticky prints (including fingerprints), etc. while handling. This causes the read mechanism to employ error correction mechanisms, like re-read, varying angular velocity, data reconstruction using parity, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. The entire read/write and disk assembly is not a sealed unit. Hence, the disk drive cannot spin the disk at fast speed as it may damage the disk and other parts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Access time of optical disks varies in the range of 100 to 300 milliseconds. Compare this with the access time of hard disks, which varies in the range of 10 to 30 milliseconds.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part142.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part144.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
