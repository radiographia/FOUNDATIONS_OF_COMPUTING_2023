The operating system cannot load a process (and hence start its execution) until sufficient free memory for loading the entire process becomes available. This may delay a process&#39;s turnaround time.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. The operating system cannot load a process (and hence start its execution) in a system whose main memory size is less than the total memory required by the process.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Virtual memory <span class="p">is a memory management scheme that overcomes these limitations by allowing execution of a process without the need to load the process in main memory completely. The process can execute even if it is loaded in main memory partially.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How is Virtual Memory Realized?</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Virtual memory mechanism uses the following three basic concepts for its realization:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>On-line secondary storage. </b>It is an on-line secondary storage device having much larger capacity than main memory. Usually, modern computer systems use high-speed disk storage for this purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Swapping. </b><i>Swapping </i>is the process of transferring a block of data from on-line secondary storage to main memory or vice-versa. When the operating system transfers data from on- line secondary storage to main memory, it is called <i>swapping in </i>of data, and when it transfers data from main memory to on-line secondary storage, it is called <i>swapping out </i>of data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Demand paging. </b>In a virtual memory system, the operating system partitions all processes into pages, which reside on on-line secondary storage. The operating system also partitions the physical memory into page frames of same size. Now, instead of loading an entire process before its execution can start, the operating system uses a swapping algorithm (called demand paging). The algorithm swaps in only those pages of the process, which the process currently needs in memory for its execution to continue. This idea is based on the observation that since a computer executes a program&#39;s instructions one-by-one, it does not need all parts of the program in memory simultaneously. When there is no free page frame in memory to accommodate a page that the operating system needs to swap to continue a process&#39;s execution, it invokes a page- replacement algorithm to create one for the accessed page. Page replacement deals with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">selecting a page that is residing in memory, but is not in use currently. The operating system swaps out the selected page to free the page frame it is occupying, and then swaps in the accessed page of the process in the freed page frame.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Virtual memory <span class="p">is often described as a hierarchy of two storage systems - one is a low-cost, large-capacity, low-speed system (on-line disk storage), and the other is a high-cost, small- capacity, high-speed system (main memory). Operating system manages them in such a way that users feel that they have access to a single, large, directly addressable, and fast main memory. That is, from the point of view of applications programmers, effective (or virtual) size of available main memory is unlimited. However, the mechanism incurs some performance penalty due to paging in of currently needed page(s) of a process, which makes frequent inter-page calls. Modern compilers and linkers arrange memory and instruction calls in a way to minimize inter- page addressing, leading to reduced paging (page swaps).</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 37pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1921">Advantages and Disadvantages of Virtual Memory Advantages</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. It provides a large virtual memory to programmers on a system having smaller physical memory. That is, physical memory size of a system does not constrain its logical memory size.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. It enables execution of a process on a system whose main memory size is less than the total memory required by the process.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. It enables a system to start a process&#39;s execution even when sufficient free memory for loading the entire process is not available. This helps in improving the turnaround time of processes. A system can also use this feature to increase its degree of multiprogramming by accommodating program segments of a large number of users in main memory simultaneously. This, in turn, results in increasing CPU utilization and throughput of the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. It makes programming easier because while programming, programmers can concentrate on program logic without worrying about the size limitations of physical memory available.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. An analysis of execution of real programs shows that programs often do not execute all parts of their code during a typical execution run. For example, depending on data, a system may skip a large part of code of a program on some condition check and may never need to execute that part of code during that execution run. Similarly, during most execution runs of a program, a system rarely uses certain options and features of the program, such as those for handling unusual error conditions. With virtual memory mechanism, since the operating system loads parts of a program on demand, the system may never need to load certain parts of the program, which the system does not need during a particular execution run of the program. This, in turn, leads to less I/O activity than in the case when the system needs to load whole program before its execution. With less I/O, each user program would run faster, resulting in better throughput, turnaround time, and response time.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Disadvantages</h4><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. It is difficult to implement because it requires algorithms to support demand paging.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. If used carelessly, it may decrease performance instead of increasing. This happens when page-fault rate is high for a process. That is, the process spends more time in swapping out and swapping in of pages than in its execution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part361.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part363.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
