A multicore processor chip has multiple cooler-running, more energy-efficient processing cores instead of one increasingly powerful core. The multicore chips do not necessarily run as fast as the highest performing single-core models, but they improve overall performance by handling more work in parallel. For instance, a dual-core chip running multiple applications is about 1.5 times faster than a chip with just one comparable core.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multidimensional array <span class="p">An array in which each array element is indexed by an ordered list of same number of integers.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multihop wireless networks <span class="p">Wireless networks designed to provide wireless communications capability in an environment where there is no wired infrastructure yet connectivity must be maintained among users who can move around arbitrarily and can at times not be in direct transmission range of each other.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia <span class="p">Use of more than one media (such as text, graphics, animation, audio, and video) for information presentation.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia books <span class="p">A multimedia application in education sector that uses audio, animation, and video to enrich text and still images of printed books, and provide better understanding of the subject matter.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia computer system <span class="p">A computer system having the capability to integrate two or more types of media (text, graphics, animation, audio, and video) for the purpose of generation, storage, representation, manipulation, and access of multimedia information.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia database <span class="p">A collection of multimedia data items, such as text, graphics, animation, audio, and video.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia DBMS <span class="p">A set of programs to define, create, store, access, manage, and query multimedia databases.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia presentation <span class="p">A multimedia application that enables a presenter to explain a subject matter more effectively than conventional presentation to an audience because it enhances a person&#39;s comprehension capability.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia synchronization <span class="p">Deals with mechanisms to ensure the desired temporal ordering among a set of multimedia objects in a multimedia presentation.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multiple inheritance <span class="p">In OOP, inheritance need not get limited to one parent-class.
