Their size is about the same as the size of an 8½ x 11 inch notebook or smaller, and their weight is around 2 Kg or less. They are also known as laptop PCs (laptop personal computers or simply laptop) because they are as powerful as a PC, and their size and weight are such that they can be used by placing them on ones lap.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part22.htm#bookmark666" class="s23">A notebook computer uses an almost full-size keyboard, a flat screen liquid crystal display, and a trackball, stick, or touchpad (instead of a mouse because notebook computers are often used without a desk) (see </a><a href="part22.htm#bookmark666" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">1.6</span>). It also has an inbuilt hard disk and ports for connecting peripheral devices such as printer, pen drive, portable disk, etc. The lid with display screen is foldable in a manner that when not in use, a user can fold it to flush with keyboard to convert the system into notebook form. When in use, the lid with display screen is folded open as shown in the figure. Many models of laptops can be “docked” on a docking station (device with additional battery, hard disk, I/O ports, etc.) or port replicator (device with additional I/O ports) to take advantage of big monitor, storage space, and other peripherals such as a printer. Users can connect their laptop to a network and download data (read files) from other computers on the network, or access the Internet. Design of most laptops enables their users to establish wireless connectivity with other stationary computers using WiFi and Bluetooth. <i>Bluetooth </i>is an industrial specification for short-range wireless connectivity using globally unlicensed short- range radio frequency. It provides a way to establish wireless connectivity between devices such as PCs, laptops, printers, mobile phones, and digital cameras for exchange of information between them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="431" height="206" alt="image" src="Image_061.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark666">Figure 1.6. </a><span class="s21">A notebook computer (Laptop).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We can use laptops even at places where there is no external power source available (for example while traveling in a train or airplane) because they can operate with chargeable batteries. With a fully charged battery, a laptop can operate for a few hours.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Laptops normally run MS-DOS, MS WINDOWS, Mac OS, or Linux operating system. Normally, users use them for word processing, spreadsheet computing, data entry, Internet browsing, accessing and sending e-mails, and preparing presentation materials while traveling. People also often use them to make presentations at locations away from their working places by plugging them into an LCD (liquid crystal display) projection system.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark667">Processing capability of a laptop is normally as good as an ordinary PC (personal computer) because both use the same type of processor. However, microprocessors for laptops are designed to dynamically adjust their performance with available power to provide maximum power saving. In fact, design of a laptop is such that its each device uses little power and remains suspended if not used. A laptop generally has lesser hard disk storage than a PC to keep its total weight to around two Kg. A laptop is more expensive (2 to 3 times) than a normal PC with similar configuration.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part21.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part23.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
