It is a disk array with special features to improve fault tolerance, offer better performance, and allow easier storage management. It presents multiple disks of a disk array as a single storage volume, which simplifies storage management. How RAID storage offers enhanced storage capacity, performance, and fault tolerance is explained here.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Suppose we have a 4 Gigabyte disk, whose each track contains 128 sectors, each of 512 bytes. The system uses 4 sectors per cluster (also known as a block), so that every read/write access to the disk transfers 2 Kilobytes (512 bytes ´ 4) of data. The disk makes one revolution in 10 ms and can transfer a block in 0.15 ms. Now, suppose a RAID system uses 4 of these disks and puts them in the same enclosure. This 4-disk RAID unit will have total storage capacity of 4 ´ 4 = 16 Gigabytes. This results in a four-fold increase in storage capacity as compared to a single disk&#39;s storage capacity. Furthermore, this RAID unit will have blocks of 4 ´ 2 = 8 Kilobytes, which will consist of the matching blocks (the ones with the same block number) on the four disks (recall the cylinder concept of data organization when multiple disks are used in a disk pack). The access time of a block on this RAID unit will be the same as that of the individual disks, but the transfer rate will be four times since we can now deliver an 8 Kilobyte block in 0.15 ms. The transfer rate has increased from 2K/0.00015 = 13.33 Megabytes/second to 8K/0.00015 = 53.33 Megabytes/second. We can further enhance storage capacity and performance by using more number of disks in the RAID with parallel data transfer.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part158.htm">RAID Techniques</a><a class="toc0" href="part159.htm">RAID Levels</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part156.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part158.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
