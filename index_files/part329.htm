For an answer to this question, recall that one of the objectives of high-level languages is that they should be easier to learn and use by the intended users. We write computer programs to solve diversified class of problems, such as, systems-related problems, scientific and engineering problems, business and commercial problems, graphics problems, etc. The language statements and notations used in a particular problem domain may be quite different from those used in other problem domains. If we try to incorporate all types of statements and notations for solving all classes of problems in a single high-level language, the features of that high-level language will become too vast and difficult to master. Such a language will be difficult to learn and use. Moreover, designing an efficient compiler for such a language will also be a tedious task. Hence, it is more logical to have</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part329.htm#bookmark1771" class="s23">different high-level languages for different problem domains. The statements and notations used in a high-level language are picked up especially to be useful for solving a specific class of problems. For example, a scientist using a science-oriented language can use scientific formulae, and a businessman with a business-oriented language can use business terms. This makes a high- level language, meant for a problem domain, easier to learn and use by the users dealing with problems in that problem domain. Hence, today many different high-level languages exist and are in use because each one was designed for a different purpose and area of applicability. This is also obvious from the discussion of the various high-level languages in </a><a href="part329.htm#bookmark1771" class="s3">Figure </a>9.20<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="625" height="373" alt="image" src="Image_589.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="622" height="381" alt="image" src="Image_590.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="612" height="372" alt="image" src="Image_591.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="625" height="369" alt="image" src="Image_592.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1771">Figure 9.20. </a><span class="s21">Some popular high-level languages</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part328.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part330.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
