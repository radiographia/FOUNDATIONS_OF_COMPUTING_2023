In such a computing environment, multiple users can share several resources/services for cost-effective usage. Moreover, the shared resources/services can be best managed/offered centrally. A few examples of such resources/services are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">1. <b>File server. </b>It provides a central storage facility to store files of several users on a network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">2. <b>Database server. </b>It manages a centralized database, and enables several users on a network to have shared access to the same database.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">3. <b>Print server</b>. It manages one or more printers, and accepts and processes print requests from any user in a network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">4. <b>Name server. </b>It translates names into network addresses enabling different computers on a network to communicate with each other.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In these cases, it is usual to have one process that “owns” a resource or service and is in charge of managing it. This process accepts requests from other processes that want to use the resource or service. The process that owns the resource and does this management is called a <i>server process</i>, and the computer on which the server process runs is called a <i>server computer </i>because it services requests for use of the resource. Other processes that send service requests to the server are called <i>client processes</i>, and computers on which client processes run are called <i>client computers</i><a href="part27.htm#bookmark682" class="s23">. Note that there may be multiple client computers sending service requests to the same server computer. </a><a href="part27.htm#bookmark682" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">1.10</span> shows a generic client-server computing environment. It is comprised of the following entities:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">1. <b>Client. </b>A client is generally a single-user system (laptop, PC, workstation, or hand-held computer) that provides user-friendly interface to end users. It runs client processes that</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">send service requests to a server. Generally, there are multiple clients in a client-server computing environment and each client has its own system-specific user interface for allowing users to interface with the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Server.  </b>A  server  is  a  relatively  powerful  system  (workstation,  mainframe,  or supercomputer) that manages a shared resource and/or provides a set of shared user services to clients. It runs a server process that services client requests for use of the shared resource managed by the server. Hence, a server&#39;s operating system has features to handle multiple client-requests simultaneously. Servers are headless machines not having monitor, keyboard, and mouse attached to them as users do not directly interact with them and use them over network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Network. </b>A network interconnects all clients and servers of a client-server computing environment. It may be a LAN, WAN, or an Internet of networks.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A set of computers interconnected together to form a client-server computing environment is collectively known as a <i>distributed computing system </i>or <i>distributed system</i>. Client-server computing involves splitting an application into tasks and putting each task on a computer, which can handle it most efficiently. This usually means putting processing for presentation on user&#39;s machine (the client) and data management and storage on a server. Depending on the application and software used, all data processing may occur on client or be split between client and server. Server software accepts a request for service from a client and returns the results of processing that request to the client. The client then manipulates the received results and presents it in proper format to the end user.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark681">Notice that in client-server computing, the central idea is allocation of application-level tasks between clients and servers. Computers and operating systems of a client and server may be different. For example, a client may be a PC running MS-Windows OS, whereas a server may be a mainframe system running UNIX OS. In fact, a client-server computing environment may have several different types of client computers with different operating systems and several different types of server computers with different operating systems. As long as a client and server share a common communication protocol and support the same applications, these lower-level differences are irrelevant. The communication protocol enables a client and server to inter- operate even when they are different types of computers running different operating systems. One such standard communication protocol is TCP/IP.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In client-server computing environment, it is common for a server to use services of another server, and hence, be both a client and a server at the same time. For example, let us assume that a client-server computing environment has clients, a file server, and a disk block server. Any client can send a file access request to the file server. On receiving such a request, the file server checks access rights, etc. of the user making the request. However, instead of reading/writing the file blocks itself; it sends a request to the disk block server for accessing requested data blocks. Disk block server returns requested data blocks to the file server, which then extracts the desired data from the data blocks and returns it to the client. In this scenario, the file server is both a server and a client. It is a server for clients, but a client for the disk block server. Hence, the concept of client and server computers is purely role-based, and may change dynamically as the role of a computer changes.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="474" height="331" alt="image" src="Image_068.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark682">Figure 1.10. </a><span class="s21">A generic client-server computing environment.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part26.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part28.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
