Obviously, its size, weight, and design are such that a user can use it by holding it in hand. It is also known as <i>palmtop </i>because it can be kept on palm and operated.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Handheld computers are computing devices of choice for people requiring computing power anytime, anywhere. There are many types of handheld computers available today. Some popular ones are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tablet PC</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A tablet PC is a miniaturized laptop. It usually provides all features of a laptop with the following differences or enhancements:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark684">1. </a><b>Light weight. </b>A tablet PC is much lighter than a laptop. For weight reduction, their designers remove from their basic structure a few infrequently used devices and provide them as separate add on.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Screen flip. </b>A user can rotate, turn around, and flip the screen of a tablet PC over the keyboard area. When a user flips the screen over the keyboard, it hides the keyboard and leaves only the screen visible and usable. In this configuration, the user holds the tablet PC in hand and uses it as digital tablet. The display on the screen shows the content in portrait mode in this configuration (from normal landscape layout mode when using keyboard).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Handwriting recognition. </b>Usually, a tablet PC comes with a specially designed pen that</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a user can use to write directly on the screen. Underlying OS translates the pen movements to smooth plot lines that running application can understand as handwritten input.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Voice recognition. </b>Usually, tablet PCs have voice recognition feature that allows voice input capable applications to accept audio/voice commands. This feature also enables input of voice data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Special design for tablet use. </b>When a user flips the screen in tablet mode, he/she cannot use the keyboard because the screen hides it. Apart from voice and handwriting recognition, some quick access hardware keys and some on-screen programmable software keys are present. A user can use these keys to invoke predefined actions that he/she cannot make with pen, or finds it difficult to make with pen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PDA/Pocket PC</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) was originally introduced as a Personal Information Manager (PIM) device. PIM features include contact list, calendar, task list, e-mail, pocket word- processing application, pocket spreadsheet application, presentation viewer, and host of other applications that come in handy while on the move. PDA has a decent size LCD touch screen with a pen for handwriting recognition. It usually has a PC based synchronization utility that a user can use to transfer and synchronize identified data between PC and PDA. With add-on memory cards, a user can increase its storage as required. Some PDAs also provide USB extension port, which a user can use to connect to external devices for extended features like external monitor, LCD Projector, etc. Almost all PDAs have some digital camera capability as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Newer PDAs also pack network capability using WiFi, Bluetooth, etc. Due to network connectivity  option,  PDAs  have  applications  in  many  domains  such  as  medicine, teaching/training, data collection, sports, and Global Positioning System (GPS) based location and route finder. Several PDAs also provide GSM/GPRS service connectivity and, thus, their users can use them as phone for making and receiving cell phone calls, SMS, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PDAs come with several options of operating systems ranging from MS-Windows Mobile, iOS, PalmOS, SymbianOS, Linux, Blackberry OS, etc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smartphone</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Smartphone is a fully functional mobile phone with computing power. The major distinction between a PDA and a smartphone is that while PDA is mostly a computing platform like PC with optional phone capability, smartphone is a cell phone with PDA-like capability. In essence, smartphone is voice centric whereas, PDA is data centric.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Normally, smartphones are smaller than PDAs. A user can use a smartphone with one hand, whereas PDAs usually require both hands for operation.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 1.11<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows samples of some handheld computers.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="181" alt="image" src="Image_069.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark685">Figure 1.11. </a><span class="s21">Samples of handheld computers.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part27.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part29.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
