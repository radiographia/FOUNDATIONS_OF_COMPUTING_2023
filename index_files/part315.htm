They are machine dependent. We cannot execute a machine/assembly language program on any computer other than the one for which it was written.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. They require programmers to have a good knowledge of the internal structure of the computer used.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. It is difficult, error prone, and time consuming to write programs in machine/assembly language because they deal with machine-level coding and require us to write one instruction for each machine-level operation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Due to these limitations, we often refer to machine and assembly languages as <i>low-level programming languages</i>. High-level programming languages overcome these limitations of low- level programming languages. They have the following features:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. They are machine independent. We can easily port and execute a program written in a high-level language on any computer having the translator software for the high-level language.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. A programmer need not have knowledge of the internal structure of the computer on which a high-level language program written by him/her is executed. This allows programmers to concentrate on the logic of the problem rather than be concerned with the details of the internal structure of the computer. In fact, since high-level languages are machine independent, a programmer writing a program in a high-level language may not even know which computer will execute the program.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. They deal with high-level coding, instead of machine-level coding, enabling the programmers to write instructions using English words and familiar mathematical symbols and expressions. High-level coding enables use of a single instruction for several machine language instructions. For example, let us consider the same problem of adding two numbers (FRST and SCND), and storing the sum in ANSR. We saw earlier that three low-level (machine/assembly) instructions are required to perform this job. However, if we use a high-level language, only one instruction is needed to instruct the computer to do this job:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">ANSR = FRST + SCND</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This instruction is easy to understand and write because it resembles the familiar algebraic notation for adding two numbers: a = b + c.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Advent of high-level languages has enabled many users without any background in computer science and engineering to become computer programmers. This has resulted in the creation of a large number of computer applications in diverse areas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part316.htm">Compiler</a><a class="toc0" href="part317.htm">Linker</a><a class="toc0" href="part318.htm">Interpreter</a><a class="toc0" href="part319.htm">Intermediate Language Compiler and Interpreter</a><a class="toc0" href="part320.htm">Advantages and Limitations of High-level Languages</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part314.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part316.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
