Normally, they are quite general in nature in the sense that they can deal with different data formats and different types of storage medium. Some commonly used file utilities are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sorting Utility</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A file sorting utility arranges records of a file in some defined sequence. A user of sorting utility specifies the values of certain fields (known as <i>keys</i><a href="part409.htm#bookmark2050" class="s23">) of the file&#39;s records. The keys determine the sorting sequence of the file&#39;s records. The simplest case of sorting is ordering of a file&#39;s records on a single key. For example, the sequence of records of employee file in </a><a href="part409.htm#bookmark2050" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">11.4</span> <a href="part409.htm#bookmark2051" class="s23">is ascending order of employee-code, which is the key. A more complex sorting would be ordering of a file&#39;s records on two or more keys. For example, the sequence of records of employee file in </a><a href="part409.htm#bookmark2051" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">11.5</span> is by ascending order of employee-code within department-code. Here employee- code and department-code are two keys. The sorting utility first lists all records for the lowest department-code for each employee belonging to that department in ascending sequence of employee-code, then all records for next department-code, and so on. Out of these two keys in this sorting example, department-code is called <i>primary key</i>, and employee-code is called <i>secondary key</i>, because order of sorting is employee-code within department-code.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A sorting utility enables users to specify their sequencing requirements for a file by means of input parameters. Input parameters such as size and number of keys, and type of ordering (ascending, descending) vary from one sorting utility to another. These parameters decide the extent and sophistication of sorting utilities.</p><p style="padding-left: 149pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="242" height="161" alt="image" src="Image_656.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2050">Figure 11.4. </a><span class="s21">Sorting on one key in ascending employee-code sequence.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 149pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="242" height="161" alt="image" src="Image_657.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2051">Figure 11.5. </a><span class="s21">Sorting on two keys. Ascending employee-code (secondary key) within ascending department-code (primary key).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A sorting utility reads un-sequenced records of an input file, and by means of various copying techniques, ultimately produces an output file that contains the records of the input file in the desired sequence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Searching Utility</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A file searching utility finds a particular record in a file. A user of searching utility specifies values of certain fields (known as <i>keys</i><a href="part409.htm#bookmark2050" class="s23">) of the file&#39;s records. The searching utility matches the specified key values with their values in each record to search the desired record. For example, in the employee file of </a><a href="part409.htm#bookmark2050" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">11.4</span>, a user can specify the value 202 for employee-code field to search the corresponding employee&#39;s record.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2052">Efficiency of a search algorithm depends on file organization. For example, to search a record in a sequential file, the search algorithm scans the records of the file sequentially, beginning with the first record. It compares the specified key field value with the key field value of each record one-by-one. Search process terminates when the algorithm finds a record with matching key. On the other hand, direct or index sequential file organizations enable immediate access to a record with the help of either a hashing algorithm (in case of direct file organization) or an index file (in case of index sequential file organization). Users need to specify a file and key field value as input parameters to a search utility, which searches through the file and produces the desired record(s). Normally, searching a record from a direct or index sequential file requires much less time than searching a record from a sequential file.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Merging Utility</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part409.htm#bookmark2053" class="s23">A file merging utility combines records of two or more ordered (sorted) files into a single ordered file. Merging utility requires that records of each input file be sorted in the same order, although their record layout need not be identical. A merging utility places records from each of the input files in their correct relative order, producing an output file having all records in the same order as input files. </a><a href="part409.htm#bookmark2053" class="s3">Figure </a>11.6<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">illustrates merging of two input files A and B to produce an output file C.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="435" height="286" alt="image" src="Image_658.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2053">Figure 11.6. </a><span class="s21">Merging of files A and B to produce file C.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Copying Utility</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A file copying utility produces a copy of a file either from one unit of a storage device to another similar unit (such as from one tape reel to another), or from one storage medium to another (such as from tape to hard disk, or from pen drive to hard disk).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Users often use file copying utility to take back-up copies of files. For example, a user may copy a file from a hard disk to a tape for back-up purpose. File copying utilities are also known as <i>peripheral interchange programs (PIP) </i>since users often use them to copy a file from one peripheral device to another.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2054">Printing Utility</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A file printing utility prints a file on a printer to produce hard copy of its contents. Printing utilities often provide the facility to print file contents in different formats. They often provide some selection and editing facilities to enable printing of parts of files (such as specified number of records and only certain fields of records). Some printing utilities provide special formats for printing files that contain program instructions rather than data.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maintenance Utility</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">A file maintenance utility copies data from one or more files to a new file selectively, or updates</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2057">a file&#39;s contents selectively. For example, a file maintenance utility may provide features to combine data from more than one file into a single file, delete a record from a file by specifying its key value or record count, and select and copy specific fields of records from an existing file to a new file.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part408.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part410.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
