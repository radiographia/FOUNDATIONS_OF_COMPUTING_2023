Since the early 1990s, Web technologies to build Web-based systems has gone through several generations of evolutions that range from static HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) pages to Web-enabled business components that are at the foundation of currently popular Web Services (WS).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2327">Early Web-based systems had a typical client-server configuration (also called </a><i>two-tier model</i>) in which a <i>Web client </i>had a Web browser to enable users to visit Web sites (<i>Web servers</i><a href="part490.htm#bookmark2328" class="s23">) residing on different computers [see </a><a href="part490.htm#bookmark2328" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">13.2</span>(a)]. A Web server had HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) server, CGI (Common Gateway Interface) programs, and shared information stored as files or database. The Web browser enabled a Web client to send HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) forms to a Web server for processing by CGI programs. In response, the Web server sent HTML files containing <i>JavaScripts </i>(small pieces of code) to the Web client, which interpreted the JavaScript to present the desired information to a user.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The two-tier model did not support the high quality requirements of modern Web-based applications. It failed on security, scalability, maintainability, reliability, and availability. Hence, designers of Web-based systems first expanded the two-tier model to a three-tier model, and now more generally to an <i>n</i>-tier model. In the expanded model, most of the software on a Web server has been moved to a separate computer called <i>application server </i>and the resources (information) are also moved to different computers called <i>resource servers </i><a href="part490.htm#bookmark2328" class="s23">(such as a database server or a file server). The new middleware software handles communication, data translation, and process distribution among the Web, application, and resource servers [see </a><a href="part490.htm#bookmark2328" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">13.2</span>(b)]. This configuration has better security, reliability, availability, maintainability, and scalability features because of the ability to separate presentation (on Web server), business logic (on application server), and data (on resource server).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="439" height="327" alt="image" src="Image_749.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2328">Figure 13.2. </a><span class="s21">Early and modern Web-based systems.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Parallely, Web-based systems started using distributed object technologies for development of more sophisticated Web-enabled applications. <i>Distributed objects </i>are objects dispersed across a distributed system. A user having access rights for accessing an object can access it from any node of the distributed system. An object on one node can send messages to objects on other nodes. Thus, the entire distributed system appears to its users as a collection of objects. Support of distributed object-based applications requires special-purpose middleware that allows remote objects to locate, bind, and communicate with each other. A common mechanism used by such middleware is an Object Request Broker (ORB) that is responsible for these operations. Examples of middleware for distributed objects include Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) from the Object Management Group (OMG), Distributed Computing Object Model (DCOM) from Microsoft, and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) from Sun Microsystems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While distributed object-based systems provided a basic framework for building enterprise-wide distributed applications, they did not succeed in implementing business-to-business (B2B) or global applications because distributed object-based technologies were not integrated well with the Internet. For example, CORBA had its proprietary protocol, called Internet Interoperable Protocol  (IIOP),  for  communications  between  CORBA  clients  and  servers.  Hence, implementation of ORBs across organizational boundaries was difficult. Designers later introduced the concept of <i>components </i>(also called <i>business objects</i>) to address this issue. A <i>component </i>is a self-contained piece of software that has a well-defined interface and can be developed, delivered, installed, and run independently.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2329">Business objects can be Web enabled to provide highly reusable business services to Web users. This idea later became popular as </a><i>Web Services </i>(WS). WS is a result of convergence of the Web and distributed object technologies. Designers of modern Web-based systems use it for building large  Web-based  applications  for  e-commerce,  information  distribution,  entertainment, collaborative working, surveys, and numerous other activities. It allows anyone to create an electronic service and anyone else to use it, thus enabling anyone-to-anyone communications, coordination, and interaction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part491.htm">Major Elements of Internet Search Engines</a><a class="toc0" href="part492.htm">Types of Internet Search Engines</a><a class="toc0" href="part493.htm">Some Popular Internet Search Engines</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part489.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part491.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
