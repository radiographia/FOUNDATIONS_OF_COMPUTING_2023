Some frequently used utility programs are:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Disk formatting utility. </b>In file management section, we saw that different operating systems organize and use the available storage space on a disk in different ways. For example, some use contiguous allocation, some use linked allocation, and others use indexed allocation. Moreover, block size may be different for different operating systems, and an operating system may reserve certain areas of disk for storing system-related information (not for user files). To use a new disk (hard disk or optical disk) on a computer system, a user needs to format it according to the requirements of the computer&#39;s operating system. Disk formatting utility enables users to perform this task.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Disk compaction utility. </b>This utility is useful for those systems, which use the method of contiguous allocation of disk blocks to files. We saw that in this method, if a system has been in continuous use for some time, external fragmentation may lead to almost 30% of unutilized disk space. Disk compaction utility allows a user to perform disk compaction, which moves files to bring all free blocks together. Disk compaction is a time consuming operation and may take several hours. Hence, users should run this utility at night, when the system is otherwise idle.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Data compression utility. </b>This utility uses a compression algorithm to transform files into a fraction of their normal sizes, so that they occupy less storage space on disk, or the system can transfer them across a network in less time. It has an associated decompression algorithm, which it uses to convert a compressed file into its normal form and size, when a user accesses the file. It helps in significant saving of disk space (might effectively double the capacity of a disk).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1969">4. </a><b>Data backup utility. </b>A disk crash, virus, hardware malfunction, accidental deletion of files, or natural disasters like fire, earthquake, etc. can cause damage/loss of data in a computer system. Hence, we must keep extra copies (called backup data) of important data. A backup utility enables a user to create copy of data on some storage media (such as CD, pen drive, or magnetic tape) from another storage media (such as hard disk). In the event of damage/loss of data, the user can restore it from backup media. To prevent loss of critical data due to natural disasters, users should store the storage media having backup data offline (away from the computer system). However, it is not necessary to keep the backup media off-line. Some computer systems keep their backup devices on-line at a place away from main system. They use high-speed communication network between the backup device and main system, and perform automatic data backup operation over the network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Antivirus utility. </b>A <i>computer virus </i>is a piece of code attached to a legitimate program</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1971">that when executed, infects other programs in a system by replicating and attaching itself to them. In addition to this replicating effect, a virus normally does some other damage to the system, such as corrupting/erasing files. Therefore, due to its spreading nature, a virus can cause severe damage to a system.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A typical virus works as follows. An intruder writes a new program that performs some interesting or useful function (such as some game or utility) and attaches a virus to it in such a way that when anyone executes the program on his/her system, the system executes the viral code along with the program. The intruder then sends this infected program by mail to other system users, or offers it free or for a nominal charge on CDs. Now, if anyone uses the infected program on his/her system, the system executes its viral code. During its execution, the viral code selects an executable program file on hard disk randomly and checks if it has already infected the file. Most viruses include a string of characters that acts as a marker showing that a file is infected. If the selected file is already infected, the virus selects another executable file. When the virus finds an uninfected file, it infects its program by attaching a copy of itself to the end of that program and replacing the first instruction of the program with a jump to viral code. When execution of viral code finishes, it executes the previously bypassed instruction (the first instruction of original program) and then jumps to the second instruction so that the program now performs its intended function. Notice that a virus spreads because every time the system executes an infected program, the virus tries to infect more programs. Also, notice that a virus does not infect an already infected file in order to prevent an object file from growing ever longer. This allows a virus to infect many programs without increasing disk space usage noticeably.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When a computer system suffers from virus infection, the user needs to cure it. To cure an infected system, users use antivirus utilities. These utilities first identify the type of virus that has infected the computer by matching its marker against markers of well-known viruses. Once the utility has identified the type of virus, which has infected the system, it restores original programs from their infected versions by applying a detailed knowledge of the infection method used by the virus. For example, in viruses that modify jump instructions at the beginning of host program, recovery process involves restoring the original jump to the start of the host program code. However, notice that these utilities can cure known viruses only. They cannot cure a newly encountered type of virus. A good antivirus utility can cure several hundred types of viruses. Suppliers of antivirus utilities keep improving the capability of their antivirus utilities to enable them to cure larger types of viruses by updating them frequently as and when they discover new types of viruses. New generation anti-virus applications employ heuristic analyzer to monitor virus like activity and processing to tag or block memory containing seemingly dangerous instructions. This mechanism creates a working solution to tackle new viruses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part383.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part385.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
