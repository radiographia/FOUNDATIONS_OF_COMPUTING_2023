In this table, each rule number is a given condition followed by a specific action by </a>a computer. The six rule numbers, six actual conditions, and associated actions by the computer are described here.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;">Rule 1: The student is a female, and percentage marks obtained is 45% or more, and percentage marks obtained is less than 60%. The computer should write output data, add 1 to <i>Count</i>, and then read the next student&#39;s record. It is a case of a female student, who passed in second division.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;">Rule 2: The student is a female, and percentage marks obtained is 45% or more, and percentage marks obtained is not less than 60%. The computer should read the next student&#39;s record without performing any other operation. It is a case of a female student, who scored 60% or more.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;">Rule 3: The student is a female, and percentage marks obtained is not 45% or more. A dash (-) in this column against the last condition indicates that this condition is irrelevant for arriving at the action. In fact, if <i>Percentage </i>is not equal to or greater than 45, it has to be less than 60. <i>Percentage </i>greater than or equal to 60 is logically impossible. Such conditions in a decision table, which are irrelevant in arriving at an action, are known as don&#39;t care conditions and are denoted by a dash. For this rule, the computer should read the next student&#39;s record without performing any other operation. It is a case of a female student, who scored less than 45%.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="452" height="302" alt="image" src="Image_505.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1575">Figure 8.13. </a><span class="s21">Decision table for the examination problem of Example 8.6.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;">Rule 4: The student is a female, and other conditions are don&#39;t care. The computer should calculate <i>Percentage </i>after adding marks of all subjects and then proceed to test further conditions. It is a case of a female student whose <i>Percentage </i>is yet to be calculated.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;">Rule 5: The student is a male, and other conditions are don&#39;t care. The computer should read the next student&#39;s record without performing any other operation. It is a case of a male student.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;">Rule 6: In all previous five rules, it was ascertained that the current record is not a trailer record because all these rules have a value N (No) for the condition <i>Sexcode </i>= Z. In this rule, <i>Sexcode </i>is equal to Z, which indicates a trailer record. Hence, the computer should write the value of <i>Count </i>and then “Stop”. Other conditions in this rule are don&#39;t care. It is a case of a trailer record.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a decision table, “Y” means yes, “N” means no, “-” means don&#39;t care, and “X” means the computer should take this action.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part282.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part284.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
