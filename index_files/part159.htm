Different RAID levels use one or more of the RAID techniques described above. Following are the commonly accepted RAID levels:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>RAID level 0. </b>It uses cluster-level striping. Clusters can vary in size and are user- definable, but they are typically blocks of 64,000 bytes. The system partitions data into clusters and distributes the clusters evenly across multiple disks.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Obviously, this RAID type does not provide any fault tolerance. Video editing professional sometimes use it as a temporary storage space.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>RAID level 1. </b>It uses mirroring. The system copies all data on one disk to another disk. Both disks are peers (not primary and secondary). This RAID type provides fault tolerance at the cost of reducing effective storage space to half of total storage space. However, it is easy to manage and does not require significant processing time for normal operations or for recovery. Server computers often use it for storing system partition for enhanced reliability.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>RAID level 2. </b>It uses bit-level data striping with parity. The system distributes the bits</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">evenly across multiple disks and uses one of the disks to store parity. Hence, it reduces the effective storage capacity of a disk array by one disk. That is, if a system configures a disk array having “N” disks with RAID Level 2, its effective storage capacity is equal to the sum of storage capacity of “N-1” disks. This RAID type is rarely used.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>RAID level 3. </b>It uses byte-level data striping with parity. The system partitions data into bytes, distributes them evenly across multiple disks, and uses one of the disks to store parity. It reduces the effective storage capacity of a disk array by one disk. This RAID type is rarely used.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>RAID level 4. </b>It uses cluster-level data striping with parity. Clusters can vary in size and are user-definable, but they are typically blocks of 64,000 bytes. The system partitions data into clusters, distributes the clusters evenly across multiple disks, and uses one of the disks to store parity. It reduces the effective storage capacity of a disk array by one disk. This RAID type is rarely used.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>RAID level 5. </b>It uses cluster-level data striping with distributed parity for enhanced performance. The system partitions data into clusters and distributes the clusters and parity evenly across multiple disks. This provides better performance than using a single disk for parity. It reduces the effective storage capacity of a disk array by one disk. This RAID type is the most common implementation of data striping with parity.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>RAID level 6. </b>It uses cluster-level data striping with dual distributed parity for enhanced fault tolerance. It is similar to RAID Level 5, except that it uses the equivalent of two disks to store two sets of parities for all data. Hence, it reduces the effective storage capacity of a disk array by two disks. It also degrades performance as compared to RAID Level 5 because it calculates each set of parities separately.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Computer systems use this RAID type for building highly reliable storage systems. Dual parity allows any two disks to fail without data loss. Notice that if a disk fails in a disk array configured as RAID Level 5, we can restore the disk array to a healthy state in a few hours, provided a second failure does not occur during recovery time. RAID Level 6 can restore the disk array to healthy state even if a second failure occurs during recovery time. Hence, storage industry considers it the ultimate RAID level for fault tolerance.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. <b>RAID level 10 (composite of 1 and 0). </b>It is also called RAID Level 1 + 0. It uses mirroring and striping, with mirroring done before striping. This provides better fault tolerance because it can survive multiple disk failures, and performance does not degrade as much when a single disk fails. RAID Level 0 + 1, which does striping before mirroring, is an inferior RAID type.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">RAID Level 10 is the most common composite RAID type. Database applications commonly use it because it provides good I/O performance when the application cannot distribute its own data across multiple storage volumes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1165">With such a wide range of reliability features inbuilt in them, modern RAID systems have mean time between data loss (MTBL) of well over a million hours. Hence, system designers often consider them as a basic unit for building reliable computer systems. For organizations relying on information technology to run their business, unscheduled interruptions have serious consequences. As a result, today many organizations are turning to RAID as a safer way to store large amounts of data.</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part158.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part160.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
