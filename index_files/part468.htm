Stationary transceivers link wireless communication devices to a wired network infrastructure. The area covered by an individual transceiver&#39;s signal is known as a <i>cell</i>. Cell sizes vary widely. For instance, an infrared transceiver can cover a small meeting room, a cellular (mobile) phone transceiver has a range of a few miles, and a satellite beam can cover an area more than 400 miles in diameter.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Successful use of wireless computing systems faces several challenges. The important ones among them are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Lower bandwidths. </b>The channel capacity typically available in wireless networks is much lower than that available in wired networks due to limited spectrum availability, power restrictions, and noise levels.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Variable bandwidths. </b>The limited bandwidth of a mobile wireless system is also variable depending on location. Channel reuse, therefore, must be an integral part of the system in order to provide service to as many potential subscribers as possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Higher error rates. </b>Noise and interference have more impact on wireless computing systems than on wired computing systems. This, in turn, increases communication latency resulting from retransmissions, retransmission time-out delays, and error-correction protocol processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Increased security concerns. </b>Security is a greater concern in wireless systems than in wired systems since information may be traveling in free space (with the exception of infrared LANs). Moreover, a mobile network environment needs stronger level of authentication because network nodes can join or leave the network dynamically.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Dynamically changing network. </b>The topology of a mobile wireless network changes dynamically due to movements of mobile nodes, resulting in dynamic connections and disconnections of nodes. Moreover, the number of mobile nodes in a network cell varies dynamically, and large concentrations of mobile users, say, at conventions and public events, may overload network capacity.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Lost or degraded connections. </b>While communicating and moving simultaneously, users may travel beyond the coverage of network transceivers or enter areas of high interference. This often leads to degraded connectivity or even loss of connectivity of a user&#39;s mobile equipment with the system&#39;s network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Support for routing and location management functions. </b>Mobile wireless systems also need to provide support for routing functions (to maintain communication with mobility) and location management functions (to keep track of locations of mobile nodes).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. <b>Limited power. </b>Mobile nodes are battery operated and hence have limited power available. As a result, designers of mobile wireless systems must use mechanisms to minimize the power required for transmitting and receiving.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part467.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part469.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
