It delivers all types of computing and communication resources as services including hardware resources (such as compute power engine  and  storage),  software  resources  (such  as  software  libraries,  applications,  and programming tools), and communication resources (such as communication services and collaboration tools). It enables users to access these resources on-demand using various types of access devices (such as PC, Workstation, Laptop, Smartphone, and Mobile phone). A user pays only for the type and amount of services he/she uses. A pool of servers of all types aggregated for building this service model is known collectively as a <i>cloud </i><a href="part474.htm#bookmark2274" class="s23">(</a><a href="part474.htm#bookmark2274" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">12.27</span>), which is a metaphor for the Internet that is depicted in network diagrams as a cloud.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cloud computing offers several advantages to end users such as:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2273">1. No hardware acquisition costs</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. No software procurement or licensing upgrade costs</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. No operation cost for operating expensive servers</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. No need to invest for buying or leasing real estate for housing server systems</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5. No hassles of upgrading resources due to fast obsolescence</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">6. No need to hire and maintain employees for maintenance and operation of expensive IT infrastructure</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7.

Users do not know or need to know what all is inside the cloud and how they work. They only care that the cloud delivers the services they need.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">By its very nature, cloud computing architecture requires to support extremely high level of efficiency, service level availability of resources, scalability, manageability, security, and other qualities to seamlessly integrate its various components. Virtualization is the key design concept that cloud architectures use to achieve these objectives. <i>Virtualization </i>allows servers, storage devices, and other hardware and software resources to be treated as a pool of resources (rather than discrete systems), so that these resources can be shared and allocated on-demand. Cloud computing architectures support both para-virtualization and clustering. <i>Para-virtualization </i>allows a single server to be treated as multiple virtual servers so that a powerful server can be shared by and service multiple user requests simultaneously. <i>Clustering </i>allows multiple servers to be treated as a single server so that the power of multiple servers can be combined to service a single request needing a powerful server, which no single server has the capability to handle alone.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Google App Engine, Amazon Web Services, and Force.com are a few examples of cloud computing systems. <i>Google App Engine </i>services applications on Google&#39;s infrastructure.<i>Amazon Web Services </i>offers compute and storage services as <i>EC2 </i>and <i>S3 </i>respectively. <i>Force.com </i>offers application development environment as a service. It also provides necessary building blocks for an organization to build its own cloud computing system. Google&#39;s <i>Apps</i>, <i>Maps, </i>and <i>Gmail </i>are part of Google&#39;s cloud computing environment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part475.htm">Grid versus Cloud</a><a class="toc0" href="part476.htm">Service Layers of Cloud Computing</a><a class="toc0" href="part477.htm">Types of Clouds</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part473.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part475.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
