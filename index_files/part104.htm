Most CPUs have 200 or more instructions (such as add, subtract, and compare) in their instruction set. The list of instructions supported by a CPU in its instruction set forms the basis for designing the machine language for the CPU. Since each processor has a unique instruction set, machine language programs written for one computer will not run on another computer with a different CPU.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">CPUs made by different manufacturers have different instruction sets. In fact, different CPU models of the same manufacturer may have different instruction sets. However, manufacturers tend to group their CPUs into “families” having similar instruction sets. When they develop a new CPU, they ensure that its instruction set includes all instructions in the instruction set of its predecessor CPU plus some new ones. This manufacturing strategy is known as<i>backward compatibility </i>and the new CPU is said to be <i>backward compatible </i>with its predecessor. This feature allows software written for a computer with a particular CPU to work on computers with newer processors of the same family. In turn, it allows users of these computer systems to upgrade their systems without worrying about converting all their existing software.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part103.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part105.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
