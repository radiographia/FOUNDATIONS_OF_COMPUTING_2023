Although this technology supports low data rates (of the order of few Kbps), it is one of the most popular methods for wireless data communications because of wide availability of modems and analog cellular services.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Digital Cellular</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This communication technology enables computing equipment to transfer digital data over digital cellular telephone networks without the need for a modem. The various standards available for digital cellular data transmission are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA),</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The effective data transfer rate of digital cellular technology is less than that of analog cellular technology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD)</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This technology breaks digital data into small packets and inserts them into analog cellular telephone networks. It uses unused analog channels available in the analog telephone cellular infrastructure. That is, transmitters use a channel for a short transmission burst and release the channel for analog voice links. It can achieve effective data rate of 19.2 Kbps.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mobile Radio Networks</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) and Extended Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR) technologies</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">employ narrow bands for creating mobile radio network infrastructure. Utility, dispatch, and other service-oriented metropolitan area users are primary users of such infrastructure. Due to the use of narrow bands, mobile radio networks have limited data rates (of the order of 20 Kbps).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Personal Communications Services (PCS)</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PCS technology offers greater network complexity and lower end-to-end latency in wireless networks. It has two variations. Network designers use the low-tier PCS for microcell coverage for frequency reuse and low-power benefits. On the other hand, they use the high-tier PCS for large macrocells of the order of 0.5 and 3.0 kilometers in early digital cellular systems such as GSM, TDMA, and CDMA. LANs, MANs, and WANs may use PCS technology for wireless communication.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2258">Satellite</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We saw that satellites provide broadcasting, long distance, and international data communication services to stationary users. With advances in antenna design, signal reception, and other related technologies, it has now become possible to provide mobile services using satellites. Many satellite-based networks using Low-Earth-Oribit (LEO), Medium-Earth-Orbit (MEO), and Geosynchronous-Earth-Orbit (GEO) have been started to provide commercial wireless data services at relatively low data rates (below 64 Kbps). For example, Iridium is a LEO system that uses 66 satellites to provide mobile communications to every point on earth and within 50 miles above it. In Iridium, the same satellite may not serve a user throughout the duration of a call, and may hand off a call to another approaching satellite. The satellites, in concentric orbits, maintain links with up to four satellites in neighboring orbits. However, handoffs are necessary among satellites in counter-rotating orbits to maintain cross-links among satellites.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although there is a large market for satellite-based mobile services, especially in places where no (or poor) cellular/PCS service exists, due to the high initial cost and per-minute charges, users of satellite-based mobile communications remain a small minority among a much larger number of wireless users. For example, Iridium, which started its service in January 1999, has been declared bankrupt, and has terminated commercial services because the number of customers that adopted the service was much smaller than needed to maintain this multibillion-dollar network.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Microwave Systems</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We saw that microwave systems use high frequency radio signals to transmit data through space. Hence, for several years, microwave systems have been and continue to be a popular means of wireless data communications. Microwave links operate in higher frequency bands than any other technologies and offer data rates of several Mbps.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Local Multipoint Distribution Systems (LMDS)</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">LMDS is a technology for supporting point-to-multipoint applications. It uses a 28-31 GHz band with 1.3 GHz of spectrum allocated to it in the US and 3 GHz of spectrum allocated to it in Canada. LMDS uses spread spectrum and microcell technology that supports two-way data transfer rates of up to 1 Gbps. A drawback of the LMDS technology is that signal propagation at</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the 28 GHz range requires a direct line-of-sight path between the transmitter and receiver. Possible applications of LMDS technology are high-speed Internet data, video conferencing, and cable TV data transmission at several hundred Mbps.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part469.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part471.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
