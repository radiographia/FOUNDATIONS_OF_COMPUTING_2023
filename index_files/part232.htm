Hence, software testing has today evolved into a multi-stage process with its own methodology, structure, organization, and documentation. In modern software development projects, testing takes place in parallel with other activities, starting as soon as the project begins. Test planning can start immediately after the team has defined software requirements. Based on software requirements, test planners can build a master test plan, which includes testing strategies, priorities, and objectives. Based on the master test plan, testers can define test requirements (what all to test), or specific testing goals (such as performance goals). Once the testers have defined the requirements, they can start developing testing procedures designed to meet/validate those requirements and run the tests. The advantage of doing testing activities in parallel with other activities is that the team can make use of the knowledge that it had put into designing of the software for designing testing strategy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="214" alt="image" src="Image_449.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1442">Figure 7.6. </a><span class="s21">Difference between testing and debugging.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part231.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part233.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
