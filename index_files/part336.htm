In this type of computing environment, different computers often use different operating systems and computer languages. Hence, the computing environment requires a system-independent and language-independent interface to enable programs on one computer to communicate with programs on another computer. Researchers designed IDLs to fulfill this requirement. They offer a bridge between two different systems by defining an interface in a system-independent and language-independent manner. Although, IDLs originally served as a bridge between two different systems, they now also serve as a tool for communication between different software components that do not share a common language - for example, between components written in C++ and components written in Java.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In general, IDL is a standard language for defining function and method interfaces for distributed or component-based applications. Technologies such as CORBA (Common Object Request</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Broker Architecture) and COM (Component Object Model) use it heavily. Usually, users are unaware of the fact that they are using an IDL. This is because IDL is normally an integral part of the tools and development platform with which the users work.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Open Software Foundation (OSF) first created an IDL as part of their Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). DCE used IDL to create a standard way of calling a function on remote computer, popularly known as Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC involves a process called marshalling, which gathers necessary data for calling the function on remote computer. At that time, programmers who needed to reuse code simply compiled header files of C language into an application, to link the application statically with the reused code. When DCE developers were looking for a mechanism to provide the marshalling code needed in RPC automatically, they naturally adapted these header files - which programmers were creating anyway - into a format useful for this task. Hence, IDL&#39;s syntax resembles that of C language. Later, when developers introduced CORBA and COM as dynamic component reuse standards, they looked into the work done earlier with RPC for a standard. Eventually, IDL emerged as a popular way to define object interfaces in a language-independent manner.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Note that we cannot use an IDL to write actual programs because it lacks the logic and flow control structures needed to program anything useful. Instead, IDL concentrates on type definitions, both for primitive and class types, and is useful to define interfaces, not implementations.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Today, a variety of IDL is in use. A few of the various implementations include Object Management Group&#39;s (OMG) CORBA, Microsoft&#39;s MIDL (Microsoft&#39;s IDL), and IBM&#39;s System Object Model. Vendors supporting each implementation provide compilers that convert IDL source code into type libraries describing the component in question. This enables type checking at compile time for an application using the component.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part335.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part337.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
