Their functions are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">1. <b>Input unit. </b>An input unit performs inputting operation. It carries out the following functions:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a. It accepts (or reads) instructions and data from outside world.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">b. It converts these instructions and data to computer acceptable form. Units called</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">input interfaces <span class="p">accomplish this task.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">c. It supplies the converted instructions and data to the storage unit for storage and further processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">2. <b>Output unit. </b>An output unit performs outputting operation. It carries out the following functions:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">a. It accepts the produced results, which are in coded form. We cannot understand the coded results easily.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">b. It converts these coded results to human acceptable (readable) form. Units called output interfaces accomplish this task.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">c. It supplies the converted results to outside world.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">3. <b>Storage unit. </b>A storage unit performs storing operation. Specific functions of the storage unit are to hold (store):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a. The data and instructions required for processing (received from input units).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">b. Intermediate results of processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 161%;text-align: justify;">c. Final results of processing, before the system releases them to an output unit. Storage unit of all computers is comprised of the following two types of storage:</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. <i>Primary storage</i>. Primary storage of a computer system, also known as <i>main memory</i>, stores pieces of program instructions and data, intermediate results of processing, and recently produced results of those job(s) on which the computer system is currently working. The central processing unit can access these pieces of information directly at a very fast speed. However, primary storage is volatile, and it loses the information in it as soon as the computer system switches off or resets. Moreover, primary storage normally has limited storage capacity because it is very expensive.  Primary  storage  of  modern  computer  systems  is  made  up  of semiconductor devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. <i>Secondary storage</i>. Secondary storage of a computer system, also known as <i>auxiliary storage</i>, takes care of the limitations of primary storage. It supplements the limited storage capacity and volatile characteristic of primary storage. This is because secondary storage is much cheaper than primary storage and it can retain information even when the computer system switches off or resets. A computer system uses secondary storage to store program instructions, data, and information of those jobs on which the computer system is currently not working but needs to hold them for processing later. The most commonly used secondary storage medium is magnetic disk.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Central Processing Unit (CPU). </b>CPU performs processing and controlling operations. It is the brain of a computer system. In a human body, the brain takes all major decisions and other parts of the body function as directed by the brain. Similarly, in a computer system, the CPU performs all major calculations and comparisons, and also activates and controls the operations of other units of the computer system. The two components of a CPU are Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit (CU). Their functions are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark954">a. </a><i>Arithmetic Logic Unit</i>. A computer performs all calculation and comparison (decision-making) operations in the ALU. During processing of a job, the computer transfers data and instructions stored in its primary storage to ALU as and when needed. ALU does the processing and the computer temporarily transfers the intermediate results generated there back to primary storage until needed later. Hence, data may move back and forth several times between primary storage and ALU before processing of the job is over.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The engineering design of a computer’s ALU determines the type and number of arithmetic and logic operations that a computer can perform. However, almost all ALUs are designed to perform the four basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) and logic operations or comparisons such as, less than, equal to, and greater than.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. <i>Control Unit</i>. A computer&#39;s control unit does not perform any actual processing of jobs, but acts as the central nervous system for other components of the computer system. It manages and coordinates the operations of all other components. It obtains instructions from a program stored in main memory, interprets the instructions, and issues signals causing other units of the system to execute them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="396" height="203" alt="image" src="Image_306.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark955">Figure 4.1. </a><span class="s21">Basic organization of a computer system.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part98.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part100.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
