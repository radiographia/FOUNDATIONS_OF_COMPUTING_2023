Primary storage of a computer system has limited capacity and is volatile. Hence, most computer systems use additional memory, called <i>auxiliary memory </i>or <i>secondary storage</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <i>Secondary storage </i>of a computer system is non-volatile and has low cost per bit stored, but operates at speeds far slower than that of primary storage.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. A <i>sequential-access storage device </i>is one in which the arrival at a desired location is preceded by sequencing through other locations so that access time varies according to location. On the other hand, a <i>random-access storage device </i>is one in which we can reach and access any storage location at random, and approximately equal access time is required for accessing each location.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <i>Magnetic tape </i>is the most popular storage medium for large data sets, which applications need to access and process sequentially. Magnetic tape medium is a plastic ribbon usually</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">½-inch or ¼-inch wide. Its surface has a coating (such as iron oxide or chromium dioxide) that can record data by magnetization. Tape ribbon itself is stored in reels, or a small cartridge, or cassette.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">5. The tape of magnetic tape storage has vertical columns, called<i>frames, </i>and horizontal rows called <i>channels </i>or <i>tracks</i>. Each frame records a character.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6. Storage capacity of a magnetic tape is a multiple of its data recording density and length.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7. A <i>magnetic tape drive </i>enables storage/retrieval of data on/from magnetic tape.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8. A <i>tape controller </i>controls a tape drive connected to it. It interprets the commands for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">operating the tape drive.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. The four commonly used types of magnetic tapes are ½-inch tape reel, ½-inch tape cartridge, ¼-inch streamer tape, and 4-mm digital audio tape.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">10. <i>Magnetic disk </i>is the most popular direct-access secondary storage device. A magnetic disk is a thin, circular plate/platter made of metal or plastic and coated on both sides with a recording material (such as iron oxide), which can be magnetized. The disk itself is stored in a specially designed protective envelope, or cartridge, or several of them are stacked together in a sealed, contamination-free container.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. A magnetic disk&#39;s surface has a number of invisible, concentric circles called <i>tracks</i>. Each track has multiple <i>sectors</i>. A sector is the smallest unit of data access by a disk drive. In case of disk units having multiple disk plates, a set of corresponding tracks on all recording surfaces together form a <i>cylinder</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">12. Storage capacity of a disk system is a multiple of its number of recording surfaces, number of tracks per surface, number of sectors per track, and number of bytes per sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">13. A disk&#39;s data access time depends on seek time, latency, and transfer rate. The time required to position the read/write heads on the specified track/cylinder is called <i>seek time</i>. The time required to spin the specified sector under the head is called <i>latency</i>. <i>Transfer rate </i>is the rate at which a system reads/writes data from/to the disk into main memory.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">14. A <i>magnetic disk drive </i>contains all mechanical, electrical, and electronic components for holding one or more disks and for reading/writing of data from/to it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">15. A <i>disk controller </i>controls a disk drive connected to it. It interprets the commands for operating the disk drive.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">16. Depending on the type of packaging, magnetic disks are classified into Zip/Bernoulli disks, disk packs, and Winchester disks.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">17. An <i>optical-disk </i>storage system consists of a metallic or plastic disk coated with a reflective material. It uses laser beam technology for reading/writing of data from/to disk surface.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">18. Storage capacity of an optical disk is a multiple of its number of sectors and number of bytes per sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">19. An <i>optical disk drive </i>contains all the mechanical, electrical, and electronic components for holding an optical disk and for reading/writing of data from/to it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">20. Commonly used types of optical disks are CD-ROM, WORM (CD-R), CD-RW, and DVD. <i>CD-ROM </i>disk is a read-only storage medium. <i>WORM </i>(CD-R) disk is a write-once, read-many storage medium. CD-RW disk allows erasing of previous content and writing on it multiple times. DVD is a standard format for distribution and interchange of digital content in both computer-based and consumer electronics products. The format enables storage of various types of large multimedia data on a new and improved version of CD, which works on optical disk technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">21. <i>Memory storage devices </i>use flash memory technology for secondary storage devices. Three popular memory storage devices are<i>Solid State Drive </i>(SSD), <i>flash drive </i>(pen drive) and <i>memory card </i>(SD/MMC).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">22. <i>Hybrid Secondary Storage Drives </i>use both SSD and HDD.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">23. <i>Mass storage devices </i>use multiple units of a storage media to create a single secondary storage device. Commonly used types of mass storage devices are <i>disk array </i>(also known as RAID), <i>automated tape library</i>, and <i>CD-ROM jukebox</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">24. A <i>disk array </i>(also known as a <i>RAID</i>) is a mass storage device that uses a set of hard disks, hard disk drives, and a controller mounted in a single unit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">25. An <i>automated tape library </i>is a mass storage device that uses a set of magnetic tapes, magnetic tape drives, and a controller mounted in a single unit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">26. A <i>CD-ROM jukebox </i>is a mass storage device that uses a set of CD-ROM disks, CD-ROM drives, and a controller mounted in a single unit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">27. <i>RAID </i>(<i>Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks</i>) is a disk array with special features to improve fault tolerance, offer better performance, and allow easier storage management. It uses mirroring, striping, and striping with parity techniques for improved fault tolerance and better performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">28. To enable devices manufactured by independent vendors to be used with computers manufactured by different vendors, controllers follow some drive interfacing standards. Commonly used drive interface standards are - Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA), Fiber Channel (FC), FireWire, and Internet SCSI (iSCSI).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">29. Three commonly used processor-to-storage connectivity technologies are Direct Attached Storage (DAS), Storage Area Network (SAN), and Network Attached Storage (NAS).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">30. <i>Data backup </i>is the process of creating a copy of some data from an on-line storage device to a secondary storage backup device so that if the original data on the on-line storage device is corrupted or lost by accident, it can be retrieved from the backup device and stored back on the on-line storage device.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">31. Two basic types of backup are - full backup an incremental backup. <i>Full backup </i>method copies all data from an on-line secondary storage device to a backup device at the time of backup, whereas <i>incremental backup </i>method copies only newly created files or files changed since the last backup.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">32. As a single type of storage is not superior in all aspect (speed of access, capacity, and cost), most computer systems build their storage solutions by making use of a hierarchy of storage technologies. Such a storage solution, called <i>Hierarchical Storage System </i>(HSS), is a cost effective way of designing computer systems with large storage capacities. A typical storage hierarchy pyramid includes cache memory, main memory, on-line secondary storage devices, near-line mass storage devices, and off-line storage devices. All HSSs have <i>Hierarchical Storage Management </i>(HSM) software, which monitors the way data is used, and makes decisions as to which data can be moved safely to slower devices (near-line storage) and which data should stay on fast devices (on-line storage).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part180.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part182.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
