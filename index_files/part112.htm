Physically, this memory consists of some integrated circuit (IC) chips (see </a><a href="part99.htm#bookmark955" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">4.1</span>) either on the motherboard or on a small circuit board attached to the motherboard of the computer. A computer&#39;s motherboard usually has the flexibility to add more memory chips for enhancing the memory capacity of the system. Hence, if a user decides to have more memory than his/her computer currently has, he/she can buy more memory chips and plug them into the empty memory slots on the motherboard. Normally, service engineers do this job. Additional RAM chips, which plug into special sockets on the motherboard, are known as <i>single in-line memory modules </i>(<i>SIMMs</i>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="215" alt="image" src="Image_313.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark984">Figure 4.6. </a><span class="s21">Various types of memory chips.</span><a name="bookmark985">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">RAM chips are of two types - dynamic and static. <i>Dynamic RAM </i>( <i>DRAM</i>) uses an external circuitry to periodically “regenerate” or refresh storage charge to retain the stored data, while <i>static RAM </i>(<i>SRAM</i>) does not need any special regenerator circuit to retain the stored data. Since it takes more transistors and other devices to store a bit in a static RAM, these chips are more complicated and take up more space for a given storage capacity than dynamic RAMs do. Moreover, a static RAM is faster, costlier, and consumes more power than dynamic RAM. Due to these reasons, large memories use dynamic RAM, and static RAM is used for specialized applications. The main memory of most computers uses dynamic RAM.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Read-Only Memory (ROM)</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A special type of RAM, called <i>read-only memory </i>(<i>ROM</i>), is a non-volatile memory chip in which data is stored permanently. Usual programs cannot alter this data. In fact, storing data permanently into this kind of memory is called “burning in of data” because data in such memory is stored by using fuse-links. Once we burn fuse-links for some data, it is permanent. We can only read and use data stored in a ROM chip (we cannot change them). This is the reason why it is called read-only memory (ROM). Since ROM chips are non-volatile, a ROM chip does not lose its stored data in case of power off or interruption of power. This is unlike a volatile RAM chip. ROMs are also known as <i>field stores, permanent stores</i>, or <i>dead stores</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">System designers use ROMs to store those programs and data, which do not change and are used frequently. A computer carries out most of its basic operations by wired electronic circuits.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, several higher-level operations used frequently, require complicated electronic circuits for their implementation. Hence, instead of building electronic circuits for these operations, designers use special programs to perform them. These programs are called <i>micro-programs </i>because they deal with low-level machine functions and are essentially substitutes for additional hardware. Computer manufacturers store these micro-programs in ROMs so that users cannot modify them.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A good example of micro-program is the “system boot program”, which contains a set of start-up instructions that are executed when a system is powered on to check if the system hardware (like memory, I/O devices, etc.) is functioning properly. It looks for an operating system and loads its core part in the volatile RAM of the system to produce the initial display-screen prompt. Note that a computer needs this micro-program every time it is switched on, and the computer must retain it even when it is switched off. Hence, the computer&#39;s ROM is an ideal storage for this micro-program.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark986">Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM)</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are two types of read-only memory (ROM) - manufacturer-programmed and user- programmed. A <i>manufacturer-programmed ROM </i>is one in which data is burnt in by the manufacturer of the electronic equipment in which it is used. For example, a personal computer manufacturer may store the system boot program permanently in a ROM chip located on the motherboard of each PC manufactured by it. Similarly, a printer manufacturer may store the printer controller software in a ROM chip located on the circuit board of each printer manufactured by it. It is not possible for users of such equipment to modify the programs or data stored in the ROM chip. On the other hand, a <i>user-programmed ROM </i>is one in which a user can load and store “read-only” programs and data. That is, it is possible for a user to “customize” a system by converting his/her programs to micro-programs and storing them in a user- programmed ROM chip. Such a ROM is known as <i>Programmable Read-Only Memory </i>(<i>PROM</i>) because a user can program it. Once the user programs are stored in a PROM chip, the system can execute them in a fraction of the time previously required. A special device known as PROM-programmer is used to program a PROM chip (record information in it). However, once a user programs a PROM chip, it becomes a ROM because the information recorded in it can only be read (it cannot be changed). PROM is also non-volatile storage, i.e., information stored in it remains intact even in case of power off or interruption of power.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM)</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Once information is stored in a ROM or PROM chip, a user cannot alter it. <i>Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory </i>(<i>EPROM</i>) chip overcomes this problem by allowing users to reprogram it to store new information. R&amp;D personnel (experimenters) often use EPROMs because they frequently change micro-programs to test a system&#39;s efficiency with new programs. EPROMs are also useful for those applications in which one may like to store a program in a ROM that would normally not change, but under some unforeseen conditions one may like to alter it. When an EPROM is in use, the user can only “read” the information stored in it, and the information remains in the chip until the user erases it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">EPROM chips are of two types - <i>Ultra Violet EPROM </i>( <i>UVEPROM</i>), which requires exposing the chip for some time to ultraviolet light for erasing information stored in it, and <i>Electrically</i></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">EPROM <span class="p">(</span>EEPROM<span class="p">), which requires use of high voltage electric pulses for erasing information stored in it. It is easier to alter information stored in an EEPROM chip as compared to an UVEPROM chip. EEPROM is also known as </span>flash memory <span class="p">because of the ease with which a user can alter programs stored in it. Many new I/O and storage devices like USB (Universal Serial Bus) pen drive and MP3 music player use flash memory.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part111.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part113.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
