Users use them primarily for processing complex scientific applications requiring enormous processing power. Scientists often build models of complex processes and simulate them on a supercomputer. For example, in nuclear fission, when a fissionable material approaches a critical mass, scientists may want to know exactly what will happen during every millisecond of a nuclear chain reaction. Such scientists use a supercomputer to model actions and reactions of literally millions of atoms as they react. A scientific application like this involves manipulation of a complex mathematical model, often requiring processing of trillions of operations in a reasonable time, necessitating use of a supercomputer. Some supercomputing applications (applications that need supercomputers for processing) are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Petroleum industry uses supercomputers to analyze volumes of seismic data gathered during oil-seeking explorations to identify areas where there is possibility of getting petroleum products inside the earth. This helps in more detailed imaging of underground geological structures so that expensive resources for drilling and extraction of petroleum products from oil wells can be effectively channelized to areas where analysis results show better possibility of getting petroleum deposits.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Aerospace industry uses supercomputers to simulate airflow around an aircraft at different speeds and altitude. This helps in producing effective aerodynamic designs to develop aircrafts with superior performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Automobile industry uses supercomputers to do crash simulation of an automobile design before releasing it for manufacturing. Doing so is less expensive, more revealing, and safer than crashing a real model. This helps in producing better automobiles that are safer to ride.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Structural  mechanics  industry  uses  supercomputers  to  solve  complex  structural engineering problems that designers of various types of civil and mechanical structures need to deal with to ensure safety, reliability, and cost effectiveness. For example, designer of a large bridge has to ensure that the bridge must work in various atmospheric conditions and pressures from wind velocity, etc., and under different load conditions. Actual construction and testing of such expensive structures is prohibitive in most cases. Using mathematical modeling techniques, various combinations can be tried out on a supercomputer without going for actual construction/manufacturing of such structures and optimum design can be picked up for final implementation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark677">5. Meteorological centers use supercomputers for weather forecasting. They feed weather data, supplied by a worldwide network of space satellites, airplanes, and ground stations, to a supercomputer. The supercomputer analyzes the data using a series of computer programs to arrive at forecasts. This analysis involves solving of complex mathematical equations modeling atmosphere and climate processes. For example, in India, the National</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), located in New Delhi, uses supercomputer for medium range weather forecasts that is crucial for Indian agriculture.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. Material  scientists  and  physicists  use  supercomputers  to  design  new  materials. <i>Nanostructure technology </i>requires microscopic investigation of mechanical, electrical, optical, and structural properties of materials having dimensions of the order of nanometer. For this, scientists need to simulate nano-scale materials like clusters of atoms, quantum dots, quantum wires, etc. using principles of molecular dynamics technique. Such simulations are compute-intensive as they combine complexity of molecular dynamics and electronic structure. Hence, they need supercomputers to complete them in a reasonable time.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. Film and TV industries use supercomputers to create special effects for movies and TV programs. Supercomputers help in producing computer-generated images using advanced graphics features in a short time. Movies or TV programs incorporate the produced images in them to create special effects. Thus, supercomputers substantially reduce the time needed to produce a full-length feature film having several special effects.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Supercomputers use <i>multiprocessing </i>and <i>parallel processing </i>technologies to solve complex problems faster. That is, they use multiple processors, and parallel processing enables dividing a complex problem into smaller problems that different processors can process in parallel. A <i>parallel program </i>breaks up a problem into smaller computational modules so that different processors can work independently and cooperate to solve it faster. Hence, if the problem takes 100 hours to process on a single-processor system and if it can be broken into 100 smaller computational modules, a supercomputer having 100 processors can theoretically solve it in about one hour. Since modern supercomputers use parallel processing technology, they are also known as <i>parallel computers </i>or<i>parallel processing systems</i>. They are also known as <i>massively parallel processors </i>because they use thousands of processors.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We measure speed of modern supercomputers in teraflops and petaflops. A teraflop is 10<span class="s22">12 </span>floating-point arithmetic operations per second and a petaflop is 10<span class="s22">15 </span>floating-point arithmetic operations per second.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A supercomputer, due to its specialized nature and huge cost, is often treated as a national resource that is shared by several academic and research organizations. For developing countries, it is not economically viable to have many such systems because of the cost involved in setting up a supercomputing facility, maintaining the facility, and fast obsolescence of technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part26.htm#bookmark678" class="s23">Major vendors of supercomputers include Cray Research Company, IBM, Silicon Graphics, Fujitsu, NEC, Hitachi, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel. Realizing the importance of supercomputers in a country&#39;s overall progress, national effort to build indigenous supercomputers has been underway in India.
