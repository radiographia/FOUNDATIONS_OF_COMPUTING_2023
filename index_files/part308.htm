However, writing a program in machine language has the following disadvantages:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Machine dependent</b><i><b>. </b></i>As the internal design of one type of computer is different from other types, machine language differs from computer to computer. Hence, after the programmers of a company have become proficient in the machine language of one type of computer, if the company decides to change to another type, they will have to learn a new machine language, and would have to rewrite all existing programs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Difficult to program. </b>It is difficult to write a program in machine language because the programmer has to either memorize the dozens of operation code numbers for the commands in the machine&#39;s instruction set, or refer to a reference card constantly. The programmer must also keep track of storage locations of data and instructions for which he/she must be knowledgeable about the hardware structure of the computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Error prone. </b>Since a programmer has to remember the opcodes and must keep track of storage locations of data and instructions, it is difficult for him/her to concentrate fully on the logic of the problem, resulting in programming errors. Moreover, due to lack of any immediate visual indication of an error as the programmer writes machine language code, it makes removal of such errors difficult.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Difficult to correct or modify. </b>It is difficult to correct machine language programs because checking machine instructions to locate errors is difficult and time consuming.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Similarly, modifying a machine language program later is so difficult that many programmers prefer to code the new logic afresh, instead of incorporating modifications in the old program.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Due to these limitations, present day programmers rarely use machine language for writing programs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part307.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part309.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
