A public cloud accepts requests for services from many customers and offers services to its customers from the resources in the cloud. Hence, it services jobs of many different customers simultaneously, but an end user is unaware of other users receiving the service simultaneously by the same server, network, storage, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Private clouds. </b>Many organizations do not want to avail services of public clouds because of security issues. Such an organization often builds a private cloud for use by its employees within the organization. A private cloud works in a manner similar to a public cloud with the exception that only employees within the organization (which owns the private cloud) can make use of its services.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Hybrid clouds. </b>Hybrid clouds combine public and private models. In this model, an organization owns a cloud, provides controlled access to some of its services to employees within the organization, and offers its other services to outside world in a controlled manner. Hybrid clouds add the complexity of determining how to distribute applications and other services across these different environments (user groups).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part476.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part478.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
