During</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">processing, the tape moves from a supply reel to a take-up reel via two vacuum columns and through a read/write head assembly. The read/write head assembly reads/writes data from/to the tape. It is a single unit having one read/write head for each tape track. Therefore, the read/write head assembly of a 9-track tape drive will have a set of nine heads. Each head operates independently and stores information on nine tracks parallel to the edge of the tape. This method of storing data in adjacent bit configurations is known as <i>parallel representation</i>. In parallel representation, a tape drive reads/writes data a byte at a time.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1099" class="s23">Different tape drives use different mechanisms to prevent tape damage from sudden bursts of speed. For example, the tape drive of </a><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1099" class="s3">Figure </a>5.8<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">uses two vacuum columns to take up slack tape, acting as buffers, to prevent the tapes from snapping or stretching when starting from a stationary position or slowing down from full speed.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Users commonly use magnetic tape reels as archival storage for off-line storage of data and for exchange of data and programs between organizations. Mainly organizations having large computing systems (such as mainframe systems) use them because the tape controller and tape drives of magnetic tape reels are bulky and expensive. Many medium-sized business organizations have vaults containing several thousands of tape reels. For example, a large insurance company may have a storage area containing over 50,000 magnetic tape reels. However, tape cartridge, streamer tape, and digital audio tape are fast replacing magnetic tape reels because these new magnetic tape storage devices are more compact, cheaper, and easier to handle and use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 164pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="202" height="146" alt="image" src="Image_343.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1097">Figure 5.7. </a><span class="s21">Magnetic tape in reel form.</span><a name="bookmark1098">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 152pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="234" height="215" alt="image" src="Image_344.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1099">Figure 5.8. </a><span class="s21">Tape drive of a magnetic tape reel.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Half-inch Tape Cartridge</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1100" class="s23">Tape cartridges look similar to audio or video cassettes used few years ago in home music or video systems (see </a><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1100" class="s3">Figure </a>5.9<span class="p">).

They also simplify mounting of tape on tape drive as compared to magnetic tape reels. Moreover, tape cartridges provide protection against dirt and contamination because of its sealing inside the cartridge.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to the differences in shape and size of tapes and mechanical operation of their tape drives, the two main differences in data organization and data recording/reading of half-inch tape reels and half-inch tape cartridges are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Half-inch tape cartridge has 36 tracks, as opposed to 9 tracks for most half-inch tape reels. Like tape reels, tape cartridges also store data using parallel representation. Hence, 4 bytes of data is stacked across the width of the tape in case of tape cartridges, as opposed to a single byte of data in case of tape reels. This enables more bytes of data to be stored on the same length of tape.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Tape cartridges record/read on the top half of the tape in one direction and on the bottom half in the other direction. That is, out of 4 bytes (36 tracks) of data stacked across the width of the tape, it reads 2 bytes (18 tracks) of data in each direction. Recall that tape reels record/read data in one direction only.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Quarter-inch Streamer Tape</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1101">In addition to storage of data for sequential data processing applications, one of the primary uses of magnetic tapes is to serve as backup storage medium for data stored on on-line devices such as a disk. During backup or recovery process, backup mechanisms process backup tapes continuously from beginning to end because there is no need for selective access of records. Hence, there is no need to start and stop a backup tape after every few records. Based on this idea, researchers came out with a special type of quarter-inch streamer tape, eliminating the need for start/stop operation of traditional tape drives for half-inch tape reels or tape cartridges. As there is no start/stop mechanism, streamer tape drives can read/write data more efficiently than traditional tape drives, which stop and restart tape movement at each IBG. Moreover, streamer tape drives also utilize tape storage area more efficiently. Typically, streamer tapes use 97% of tape for data storage, whereas traditional start/stop tapes use only 35% to 70%, depending on blocking factor. These tapes are ¼-inch wide and sealed in a cartridge. Their tape drives are</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1103">similar in look and mechanical operation to the tape drives of half-inch tape cartridges.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unlike half-inch tapes, which use parallel representation for data recording, these tapes use <i>serial representation </i><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1102" class="s23">for data recording. That is, they align data bits in a row, one after another in tracks. A streamer tape can have from 4 to 30 tracks, depending on tape drive. Depending on tape drive, read/write head reads/writes data from/to one, two, or four tracks at a time. </a><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1102" class="s3">Figure</a></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1102" class="s3">5.10</a><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1102" class="s24"> </a><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1102" class="s23">shows a streamer tape having 8 tracks. It records data on two tracks at a time. That is, it </a>first writes data on the top two tracks for entire length of the tape or until the data is exhausted. If it reaches end of the tape while recording the data, it rewinds the tape, positions the read/write head on the next two tracks, and continues recording the data in a similar manner.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Streamer tapes are so called because they read/write data serially as streams of bits. They use a data format known as the <i>QIC (Quarter Inch Cartridge) standard</i>. Standard data format helps in easy use of these tapes for exchanging data between different computers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="489" height="190" alt="image" src="Image_346.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: -138pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1102">Figure 5.10. </a><span class="s21">Serial representation of data on a streamer tape having 8 tracks.

It uses a tape ribbon of 4mm width enclosed in a cartridge. Tape length is either 60 meters or 90 meters. For very high data recording density, its tape drive uses <i>helical scan </i><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1104" class="s23">technique for data recording. As </a><a href="part134.htm#bookmark1104" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">5.11</span> shows, helical scan has two read heads and two write heads built into a small wheel (or cylinder) that spins near the tape at about 2000 rpm. The tape also moves at a relatively slow speed of about ?-inch per second. The two write heads write data with opposite magnetic polarities on overlapping areas of the tape. Each read head reads only one polarity or the other. The result is high data density per inch of tape. The helical scan records data on the tape at an angle to the tape.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">DAT drives use a data-recording format called Digital Data Storage (DDS), which provides three levels of error correcting code to ensure excellent data integrity. Storage capacity of DAT cartridges varies from 4 GB to 14 GB, and data transfer speed of DAT drives is about 366 KB/sec.</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="375" height="159" alt="image" src="Image_347.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1104">Figure 5.11. </a><span class="s21">Helical scan technique used for data recording by a DAT drive.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part133.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part135.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
