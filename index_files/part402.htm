For example, M, 8, and $ are characters. A bit is basic unit of primary and secondary storage, and a character is basic unit of human perception.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Field. </b>A field is a combination of multiple related characters. For example, if we are processing employees&#39; data of a company, we may have one field each for employee code, employee name, worked hours, hourly pay rate, tax rate deduction, etc. A <i>field </i>is a meaningful collection of related characters. It is the smallest logical data entity treated as a single unit in data processing. Note that a field may sometimes have a single character, such as sex-code field may have value M or F.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Record. </b>A record is a combination of multiple related fields. For example, an employee record has fields containing data of an employee, such as employee&#39;s code, name, worked hours, pay rate, tax rate deduction, etc. Similarly, a student record has fields containing data of a student. Hence, a record is a collection of related fields, which data processing applications treat as a single unit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2034">5. </a><b>File. </b>A file is a combination of multiple related records. For example, a collection of employee records of all employees of a company forms an employee file. Similarly, a collection of all inventory records of a company forms an inventory file. Hence, a <i>file </i>is a number of related records, which the system treats as a unit. Notice that every record in a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">file has the same set of fields. A <i>key field </i>uniquely identifies each record in a file. Contents of the key field are unique for every record in the file. For an employee file, employee-code field may serve as the key field.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Database. </b>A database is an integration of multiple related files. For example, an employee database of an organization may integrate records of multiple employee files, such as employee salary file containing details of salary and taxation information of all employees, employee personal information file containing general information (age, sex, address, etc.) of all employees, and employee skill-set file containing details of various types of skills of all employees. A database integrates data from multiple files in a manner to minimize data redundancy. For instance, in case of the example above of three different employee files, if in each file an employee record contains an employee-address field, and if an employee changes his/her residence, the organization must change the employee&#39;s address in all three files. A database requires change in the employee&#39;s address only once because it integrates the three files in such a manner that it needs to store an employee&#39;s address data only once and makes the same copy available to all applications. In essence, a database is a collection of logically related data elements from multiple files.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 11.2<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">illustrates relationship among character, field, record, and file with an example.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="503" height="246" alt="image" src="Image_652.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2035">Figure 11.2. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating relationship among character, field, record, and file.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part401.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part403.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
