Moreover, often a large number of users need to share a common computing facility such as in research groups, educational institutions, engineering firms, etc. Mainframe systems are used for meeting the computing needs of such organizations.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part25.htm#bookmark674" class="s3">Figure </a>1.8<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows a configuration of a mainframe system. It consists of the following components:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark673">1. </a><b>Host, front-end, and back-end computers. </b><a href="part25.htm#bookmark674" class="s23">A mainframe system usually consists of several subordinate computers in addition to the main or host computer. Host computer carries out most computations, and has direct control of all other computers. Other computers relieve the host computer of certain routine processing requirements. For example, a front-end computer handles all communications to/from all user terminals, thus  relieving  host  computer  of  communications-related  processing  requirements. Similarly, a back-end computer handles all data I/O operations, thus relieving host computer of locating an I/O device and transferring data to/from it. Host and other computers are located in a system room to which entry is restricted to system administrators and maintenance staff only (see </a><a href="part25.htm#bookmark674" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">1.8</span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Console(s). </b>One or more console terminals (located in system room) connect directly to the host computer. System administrators use them to monitor the system&#39;s health, or perform some system administration activities such as changing system configuration, installing new software, taking system backup, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Storage devices. </b>For large volume data storage, users connect several magnetic disk drives (located in system room) directly to the back-end computer. Host computer accesses data on these disks via the back-end computer. In addition, there are few tape drives and a magnetic tape library for backup/restoration of data to/from magnetic tapes. System administrators use the tape library (located in system room) to backup data from magnetic disks to magnetic tapes. Tape drives (located in users&#39; room) enable users to bring their input data on tape for processing, or to take their output data on tape after processing.</p><p style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="537" alt="image" src="Image_065.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 140pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark674">Figure 1.8. </a><span class="s21">A mainframe system. System room is shaded.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark675">4. </a><b>User terminals. </b>User terminals serve as access stations. Users use them to work on the system. Although, the figure shows all user terminals in users&#39; room, some of them may be located at geographically distributed locations. Since mainframe systems allow multiple users to use the system simultaneously (through user terminals), their operating systems support multiprogramming with timesharing. This enables all users to get good response time, and an illusion that the system is attending to their jobs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Output devices. </b>User terminals also serve the purpose of soft copy output devices. However, for hard copy outputs, there are one or more printers and one or more plotters connected to back-end computer. These output devices are also located in users&#39; room so that users can easily access them to collect their outputs.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part25.htm#bookmark674" class="s23">Configuration of a mainframe system depends a lot on the type of its usage and the kind of its users. The example of </a>Figure 1.8<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">is just one possible configuration.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A mainframe system looks like a row of large file cabinets, and needs a large room with closely monitored humidity and temperature. It may cost anywhere from few tens of lakhs to few crores</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of rupees depending on configuration. Mainframe systems having smaller configuration (slower host and subordinate computers, lesser storage space, and fewer user terminals) are known as <i>minicomputers, </i>but there is no well-defined boundary for differentiating between the two. Two major vendors of mainframe systems are IBM and Fujitsu.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part24.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part26.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
