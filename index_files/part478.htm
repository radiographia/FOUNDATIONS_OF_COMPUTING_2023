The three basic elements of any communication system are a sender (source) that creates and sends a message, a medium that carries the message, and a receiver (sink) that receives the message.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Three modes of data transmission are simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex. A <i>simplex </i>communication  system  can  transmit  data  in  one  direction  only.  A  <i>half-duplex </i>communication system can transmit data in both directions, but in only one direction at a time. A <i>full-duplex </i>communication system allows data to flow in both directions simultaneously.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <i>Bandwidth </i>of a communication system refers to its data transfer rate (amount of data that it can transfer per unit of time). Higher the bandwidth of a communication system, the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">more data it can transfer in a given time.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4. Bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps) (also called <i>baud</i>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. There are several types of physical channels (communication media) used for data transmission from one point to another. Some popular ones are twisted-pair wire (UTP cable), coaxial cable, microwave system, communications satellite, and optical fibers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <i>Modulation </i>is the technique of converting a digital signal to its analog form, and <i>demodulation </i>is the reverse process of converting an analog signal to its digital form. Three forms of modulation are Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Phase Modulation (PM).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. Communication systems use a special device called <i>modem </i>( <b>mo</b>dulator/<b>dem</b>odulator) to perform modulation and demodulation (conversion of digital data to analog form and vice-versa).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. Data-transmission-service providers are known as <i>common carriers</i>. Types of services, which common carriers typically offer are dial-up line, leased line, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), and Value Added Network (VAN).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. The  method  of  dividing  a  physical  channel  into  multiple  logical  channels  to simultaneously transmit a number of independent signals through it is known as <i>multiplexing</i>. The electronic device that performs this task is known as <i>multiplexer.</i></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">10. Two basic methods of multiplexing communication channels are Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. A <i>concentrator </i>is an intelligent multiplexer, which performs the same function as a multiplexer, but has the ability to actually reduce the number of signals.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">12. A <i>front-end processor </i>is a special device connected to a computer, which handles all communication-processing jobs of the computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">13. Two modes of data transmission on a communication line are asynchronous and synchronous. In <i>asynchronous transmission</i>, a sender sends data at any convenient time and the receiver accepts it. On the other hand, in <i>synchronous transmission</i>, a sender and receiver must synchronize with each other to get ready for data transmission before it takes place.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">14. Three different methods of establishing communication links between a sender and a receiver in a communication network are<i>circuit switching</i>, <i>message switching, </i>and <i>packet switching</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">15. <i>Routing techniques </i>determine the path for transmission of a message/packet in a WAN.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">16. A network&#39;s <i>topology </i>refers to the way in which the network links its nodes (computers or other communication devices) together. It determines the various data paths available between any pair of nodes in the network. Although, the number of possible network topologies is seemingly limitless, four major ones are star, ring, completely connected, and multi-access bus.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">17. Based  on  characteristics  such  as  geographic  distribution  of  nodes,  purpose, communication link, ownership, communication cost, and communication technologies used, networks are of five types: PAN, LAN, CAN, MAN, and WAN.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">18. A <i>communication protocol </i>or <i>network protocol </i>describes the rules that govern the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">transmission of data over communication networks. These rules provide a method for orderly and efficient exchange of data between the sender and receiver, and for proper interpretation of controls and data transmitted as raw bits and bytes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">19. <i>Network Interface card</i>, often referred to as <i>NIC </i>or <i>network card</i>, is a hardware device that connects a computer to a network, both functionally and physically.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">20. Computer networks use a concept of layered protocols. The <i>OSI model </i>provides a standard for layered protocols for WANs. The seven layers of the OSI model are physical, data-link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application. Of the available protocol suites for network systems, the Internet Protocol (IP) suite is the most popular and widely used.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">21. Interconnecting two or more networks to form a single network is called <i>internetworking</i>, and the resulting network is called an <i>internetwork</i>. The goal of internetworking is to interconnect  different  physical  networks  and  to  hide  their  details,  enabling  the internetwork  to  function  as  a  single  coordinated  unit.  Three  commonly  used internetworking tools to interconnect two or more networks to form a single network are bridges, routers, and gateways. The Internet is the best example of an internetwork.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">22. A <i>wireless computing system </i>enhances functionality of computing equipment by freeing communication from location constraints of wired computing systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">23. Wireless computing systems are of two types - <i>fixed wireless systems </i>that support little or no mobility of its computing equipment, and <i>mobile wireless systems </i>that support mobility of computing equipment used to access the resources of wireless network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">24. Technologies that wireless communication systems use for wireless communication include analog cellular, digital cellular, Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPC), mobile radio networks, Personal Communications Services (PCS), satellite, microwave systems, and Local Multipoint Distribution Systems (LMDS).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">25. Some popular wireless technologies and standards include 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, Wireless LAN (WLAN), WiMAX, Wireless Local Loops (WLLs), radio- router technology, multihop wireless networks, and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">26. <i>A distributed computing system </i>is a configuration, which consists of many independent computer systems (which may be geographically far apart) interconnected by a communication network, and in which cooperating computer systems exchange messages, processing tasks, programs, data, and other resources over the network. Such an arrangement, enables sharing of hardware and software resources, as well as information, among several users who may be far away from each other.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">27. <i>Grid Computing </i>is a wide-area distributed computing system designed to provide a utility- oriented infrastructure to its users. It offers computational power (resources, services, data) to its users in the same manner as electrical power and other utilities are available today to their users.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">28. <i>Cloud Computing </i>is a distributed computing paradigm, which delivers all types of computing and communication resources as services including hardware resources (such as compute power engine and storage), software resources (such as software libraries, applications,  and  programming  tools),  and  communication  resources  (such  as</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">communication services and collaboration tools). It enables users to access these resources on-demand using various types of access devices (such as PC, Workstation, Laptop, Smartphone, and Mobile phone). A user pays only for the type and amount of services he/she uses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part477.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part479.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
