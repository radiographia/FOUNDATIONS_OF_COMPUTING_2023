Obviously, users do not need all functionalities of an operating system all the time. As a system has limited main memory, it is customary to keep only a small part of the operating system in system&#39;s memory, and to keep its remaining part on an on-line storage device such as hard disk. Those modules of an operating system, which need to be always resident in system&#39;s main memory, are called <i>resident modules, </i>whereas those that reside on hard disk are called <i>non-resident modules</i>. The operating system loads a non-resident module into the memory on demand (whenever a user process needs it for execution).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Readers should not confuse between an operating system kernel and its resident modules. The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">two are not the same. In fact, for most operating systems they are different. Normally, the following two criteria determine whether a module of an operating system should be resident:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Its frequency of use, and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Whether the system can operate at all without it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For example, an operating system can maintain its file directories on disk and load a directory into memory when it requires it. Similarly, an operating system can swap out status information for inactive processes on disk. In fact, the resident part of an operating system is a subset of its kernel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part379.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part381.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
