However, such DBMSs cannot effectively model some situations. For example, consider an inventory database of items sold by a department store. For each item, it stores current quantity,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">price, and registered vendor&#39;s details. The database is connected to the point-of-sale terminals of the store. When a customer purchases an item, the sales person makes its entry in a point-of-sale terminal for billing. This information goes from point-of-sale terminal to the database, which updates the current quantity field of the item. To ensure that an item never runs out of stock in the store, the store wants to place an order for the item as soon as its quantity in the inventory falls below a threshold value. To do this in a passive database system would require the store to implement a polling mechanism, which checks periodically the quantity of every item in the inventory and prints a list of those items, whose quantity is less than its threshold value. The store then places new orders for the items in this list. Main difficulty in implementing this mechanism is how to decide the most appropriate polling frequency. If it is too high, there is a cost penalty. On the other hand, if it is too low, the reaction may be too late to meet the requirement of no item running out of stock.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The best way to handle such an application would be to make the system place an order with the registered vendor automatically, as soon as the current quantity of an item goes below its threshold value. This is exactly what an active database system does. For instance, if the store implements its inventory database using an active database system, the database system can invoke an application automatically when the quantity of an item goes below its threshold value. This application prepares a purchase order for the item and sends this order to the registered vendor on e-mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An active database system supports applications of the type seen in the above example by moving the reactive behavior from the application (or polling mechanism) into the database management system. Active databases are, therefore, able to monitor and react to specific circumstances of relevance to an application.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An active database system must provide a knowledge model (that is, a description mechanism) and an execution model (that is, a runtime strategy) for supporting such applications. For this, an active database system uses rules that have up to three components - an event, a condition, and an action. The <i>event </i>part of a rule describes a happening to which the rule may be able to respond. The <i>condition </i>part of the rule examines the context in which the event has taken place. The <i>action </i>describes the task, which the rule must carry out, if the relevant event has taken place and the condition has evaluated to true. Such a rule is known as event-condition-action or <i>ECA- rule</i>. In some cases, the event or the condition may be either missing or implicit. For instance, in the application in the example above, there is no condition. Hence, it is an example of event- action rule. The event is “quantity below threshold value” and the action is “invoke the application for placing order”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part416.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part418.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
