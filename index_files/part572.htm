Any of the current versions of the Internet Protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) can add IPSec to it by means of additional headers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. It is transparent to applications because it provides security at network layer, which is below the transport layer (TCP, UDP). Hence, when an organization/user implements IPSec in its firewall/router, there is no need to change software on a user or server system. Even if a user implements IPSec in end systems, it does not affect upper layer software, including applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. As it provides security at network layer, users can ensure secure networking not only for applications that have security mechanisms, but also for security-ignorant applications. Users do not need any training to implement security mechanisms in their applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. It provides flexibility to the users to decide whether they want to encrypt their messages (not all users want encryption because it is computationally expensive). However, instead of making encryption optional, it uses null encryption algorithm, which users have praised for its simplicity, ease of implementation, and high speed.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. It offers a framework for multiple services from which a user can choose those that he/she wants. The reason for multiple services approach is that not everyone wants to pay for having all the services.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. It offers a framework for multiple algorithms. The reason for supporting multiple algorithms is that a secure algorithm of today may become insure tomorrow (may be broken). By being algorithm-independent, IPSec framework can survive even if an algorithm that it uses today is compromised (broken) later.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part571.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part573.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
