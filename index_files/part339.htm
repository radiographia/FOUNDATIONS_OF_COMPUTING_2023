For example, a user group dealing frequently with a special type of input data or a special type of input device may like to have statements to accept this input directly. In this case, the usual practice is to extend a standard language, which is most suitable for the user group applications, by adding new statements to it to support the desired features. With this extension, users of the user group can program their applications more easily. However, since the original standard language does not support the extended features (additional statements), such a program needs a language processor to translate the additional statements (extensions to the standard language) into a sequence of statements of the standard language before submitting it to the standard language compiler for compilation. Such a language processor is known as a </a><i>preprocessor</i>.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part339.htm#bookmark1797" class="s23">A preprocessor accepts as input a source program written in an extended language (with the added features) and produces an output source program that is acceptable to the compiler of the standard language (without the added features) (see </a><a href="part339.htm#bookmark1797" class="s3">Figure </a>9.27<span class="p">). The preprocessor reads each statement in the input source program and parses it to check if its syntax pertains to the added statements (extended features). If yes, it generates a sequence of statements in the standard language for the current statement to produce the same effect, else it leaves the statement unchanged. Note that the output source program generated by the preprocessor is longer than the input source program because the preprocessor generates a sequence of statements for each statement in the extended language. As the figure shows, preprocessing inevitably requires two translation passes - the first pass translates the source program in extended language to a standard language source program by using the preprocessor, and the second pass translates the standard language source program to executable object code by using the standard language compiler. However, in most cases of preprocessing, the user gets the feeling of one-pass translation. A preprocessor achieves this through creation of a library of system commands that, when invoked, runs through the two passes in one go.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 134pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="282" height="319" alt="image" src="Image_601.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1797">Figure 9.27. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating the use of a preprocessor.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part338.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part340.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
