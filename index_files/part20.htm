VLSI technology became <i>ULSI </i>(<i>Ultra-Large-Scale Integration </i>) technology in fifth generation, resulting in production of microprocessor chips having ten million electronic components. In fact, the speed of microprocessors and the size of main memory and hard disk doubled almost every eighteen months. As a result, many features found in the CPUs of large mainframe systems of third- and fourth-generation systems became part of microprocessor architecture in fifth generation. This resulted in availability of powerful and compact computers becoming available at cheaper rates and death of traditional large mainframe systems. Subsequently, processor manufacturers started building multicore processor chips instead of increasingly powerful (faster) single-core processor chips. The multicore chips improve overall performance by handling more work in parallel.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Due to this fast pace of advancement in computer technology, we see more compact and more powerful computers being introduced almost every year at more or less the same price or even cheaper. Notable among these are portable notebook computers that give the power of a PC to their users even while traveling, powerful desktop PCs and workstations, powerful servers, powerful supercomputers, and handheld computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Storage technology also advanced making larger main memory and disk storage available in newly introduced systems. Currently, PCs having few Gigabytes (GB) of main memory and few Terabytes (TB) of hard disk capacity are common. Similarly, workstations having 4 to 64 Gigabytes of main memory and few tens of Terabytes of hard disk capacity are common. <i>RAID </i>(<i>Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks</i>) technology enables configuration of a bunch of disks as a single large disk. It, thus, supports larger hard disk space with better in-built reliability. During fifth generation, optical disks (popularly known as Compact Disks or CDs) and Solid State Disks (SSD) emerged as popular portable mass storage media.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the area of large-scale systems, fifth-generation saw the emergence of more powerful supercomputers based on parallel processing technology. They used multiple processors and were of two types - shared memory and distributed memory parallel computers. In a shared memory parallel computer, a high-speed bus or communication network interconnects a number of processors to a common main memory, whereas in a distributed memory parallel computer, a communication network interconnects a number of processors, each with its own memory. These systems use parallel programming technique to break a problem into smaller problems and execute them in parallel on multiple processors of the system. Processors of a shared memory parallel computer use memory access mechanism for communication, whereas those of a distributed memory parallel computer use message-passing mechanism for communication. Distributed memory parallel computers have better scalability (can grow larger in capability) than shared memory parallel computers, and are now built by clustering together powerful commodity workstations by using a high-speed commodity switched network. This is known as <i>clustering technology</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">During fifth generation, the Internet emerged with associated technologies and applications. It made it possible for computer users sitting across the globe to communicate with each other within minutes by use of <i>electronic mail </i>(known as <i>e-mail</i>) facility. A vast ocean of information became readily available to computer users through the <i>World Wide Web </i>(known as <i>WWW</i>). Moreover, several new types of exciting applications like electronic commerce, virtual libraries, virtual classrooms, distance education, etc. emerged during the period.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The tremendous processing power and the massive storage capacity of fifth-generation computers also made them a useful and popular tool for a wide range of multimedia applications dealing with information containing text, graphics, animation, audio, and video data. In general, data size for multimedia information is much larger than plain text information because representation of graphics, animation, audio, or video media in digital form requires much larger number of bits than that required for representation of plain text. Because of this, multimedia computer systems require faster processor, larger storage devices, larger main memory, good graphics terminal, and input/output devices required to play any audio or video associated with a multimedia application program. The availability of multimedia computer systems resulted in a tremendous growth of multimedia applications during fifth-generation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the area of operating systems, some new concepts that gained popularity during fifth- generation include microkernels, multithreading, multicore operating systems and operating</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">systems for hand-held mobile devices. <i>Microkernel </i>technology enabled designers to model and design operating systems in a modular fashion. This makes operating systems easier to design and implement, easier to modify or add new services, and allows users to implement and use their own service. <i>Multithreading </i>technology is a popular way to improve application performance through parallelism. In traditional operating systems, the basic unit of CPU scheduling is a process, but in multithreading operating systems, the basic unit of CPU scheduling is a thread. In such operating systems, a process consists of an address space containing its instructions and data, and one or more threads sharing the same address space. Hence, these systems can create a new thread, switch CPU between threads, and share resources between threads of same process more efficiently than between processes, resulting in faster execution and better overall system performance. A <i>multicore operating system </i>can run multiple programs at the same time on a multicore chip with each core handling a separate program. With the advent of smart phones, tablets, smart watches and other hand-held smart electronic devices, special operating systems for these devices were designed.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the area of programming languages, concepts that gained popularity during fifth generation are JAVA programming language, and parallel programming libraries like MPI (Message Passing Interface) and PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine). JAVA is used primarily on the World Wide Web. It supports Java-based applets allowing web pages to have dynamic information and more interactivity with users of web information. MPI and PVM libraries enable development of standardized parallel programs, so that a programmer can easily port and execute a parallel program developed for one parallel computer on other parallel computers. MPI is used for distributed memory parallel computers and PVM is used for shared memory parallel computers. Recently, programming languages for programming Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications were developed. Python and R are two such languages.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 1.5<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">summarizes the key technologies and features of five computer generations. Although there is a certain amount of overlap between different generations, the approximate period shown against each are normally accepted.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Description of history of computing divided into five generations shows how quickly things have changed in the last few decades. Technological progress in this area is continuing. In fact, the fastest-growth period in the history of computing may be still ahead.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="625" height="443" alt="image" src="Image_059.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part19.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part21.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
