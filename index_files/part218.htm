If the user has an in-house software development team, the user can create the software package in-house. However, if such a team does not exist in-house, the user must get it created by another organization by placing an order for it. We follow the following steps for this:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1415">1. The user prepares a list of all user requirements carefully.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. The user then floats a tender for inviting quotations for creation of the requisite software. Sometimes, the user contacts few software houses instead of floating a tender for quotations.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. After receiving the quotations, the user selects a few of them for further interaction based on the cost quoted by them, their reputation in the market, their submitted proposal, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. The user then interacts with the representative(s) of each of the selected vendors. Based on this interaction, the user chooses a vendor to offer the contract for creation of the requisite software.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. The chosen vendor then creates the software package and delivers it to the user. Often, the vendor has to closely interact with the user during the software development process.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The vendor need not develop everything from scratch to meet the user&#39;s requirements. If one or more pre-written software packages meet the user&#39;s requirements partially, the vendor may use them along with its own developed software in such a manner that the overall software package so created meets the user&#39;s requirements fully. This helps in reducing the development cost and time needed for creation of the required software package.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If a user has to order for both hardware and software for his/her requirement, the user may choose to place the order for both to a single vendor. The vendor develops the software on the chosen hardware, and delivers the software along with the hardware to the user. We refer to this as <i>end-to-end solution </i>or <i>turnkey solution</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Following are the advantages and limitations of ordering a customized software package rather than developing it in-house:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. The user need not maintain its own software development team. Maintaining and managing such a team is expensive, and may not be justified for an organization not needing to develop software on a regular basis.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. It is easier to carry out changes in the software, if an in-house team develops it. For ordered customized software, the user needs to always depend on the vendor for carrying out the changes, and the vendor often charges separately for each request for change.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part217.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part219.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
