Main goals of computer security are secrecy, privacy, authenticity, and integrity.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. A total approach to computer security involves both external and internal security. External security deals with securing a computer system against external factors such as fires, floods, earthquakes, stolen disks/tapes, etc. The three main aspects of internal security are <i>authentication, access control</i>, and <i>communication security</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. An <i>intruder </i>is a person or program that tries to obtain unauthorized access to data or a resource of a computer system. An intruder may attack a computer system in many ways. These attacks are broadly classified into two categories - passive attacks and active attacks.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. In a <i>passive attack</i>, an intruder somehow tries to steal unauthorized information from a computer system without interfering with the normal functioning of the system. Some commonly used methods of passive attack are browsing, leaking, inferencing, and masquerading.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <i>Active attacks </i>interfere with the normal functioning of a system and often have damaging effects. Computer virus, worm, and logic bomb are three commonly used types of active attacks. Active attacks associated with message communications are integrity attack, authenticity attack, denial attack, delay attack, and replay attack.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <i>Cryptography </i>is a means of protecting private information against unauthorized access in situations, where it is difficult to provide physical security. Two broad classes of cryptosystems are <i>symmetric </i>and <i>asymmetric</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <i>Authentication </i>is the process by which a system verifies the identity of a user (person or program) before it permits the user to access a requested resource. A system&#39;s <i>authentication mechanism </i>protects the system (or some resource of the system) from an unauthorized user by verifying the user&#39;s identity.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. Normally,  computer  systems  need  authentication  mechanisms  for  user  login authentication,  one-way  authentication  of  communicating  entities,  and  two-way authentication of communicating entities.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. Basic approaches to authentication are proof by knowledge, proof by possession, and proof by property. Proof-by-knowledge method based on passwords is the most widely used method for user login authentication.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">10. <i>Access control </i>deals with the ways to prohibit a user/process from accessing such resources/information, for which he/she is not having access authorization. Access matrix model is the most popular model used in existing systems to implement access control.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. In <i>access matrix </i>model, access rights of each subject to each object are defined as entries in a matrix, called access matrix. Access control lists (ACLs) is the method used most commonly for implementing an access matrix.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">12. The concept of <i>digital signature</i>, which uses asymmetric cryptosystems, is the most commonly used method to handle the issue of message integrity in distributed systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">13. A <i>firewall </i>is a computer or communication device, which restricts flow of information between two networks in either direction or both directions. It is configured to implement some security policy (set of rules), which defines what kinds of interactions (flow of information) are permitted between the two networks.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">14. Packet-filtering router, proxy server, connection-establishment server, and Network Address Translating (NATing) server are some commonly used types of firewalls.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">15. <i>Software piracy </i>deals with illegal copying and resale of software. A <i>software pirate </i>is anyone who breaks system security for stealing intellectual property in software on that system.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">16. Three types of attacks that fall under software piracy are illegal copying, malicious reverse engineering, and tampering.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">17. Security mechanisms to protect software piracy include hardware-assisted security, hardware dongles, obfuscation, digital watermarking, and tamper proofing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">18. <i>E-mail security </i>deals with secrecy and integrity of electronic mails exchanged using e- mail applications. Some commonly used mechanisms/tools for e-mail security are Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), and Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">19. A <i>spam e-mail </i>[also known as <i>Unsolicited Bulk E-mail (UBE)</i>] is an unsolicited (unwanted, not asked for) e-mail message, which its sender sends in large quantities to an indiscriminate set of e-mail users. The act of sending a spam e-mail is known as <i>e-mail spamming </i>and a person who performs such an act is known as an e<i>-mail spammer</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">20. <i>IPSec </i>(<i>Internet Protocol Security</i>) is a security standard that adds security features at network layer so that application designers need not build security features into an IP- based application.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">21. <i>Web security </i>deals with mechanisms to deal with various types of security issues (integrity, confidentiality, denial of service, and authentication) faced in using the Web. SSL and TLS are general-purpose solutions for Web security, which implement security just above TCP within the TCP/IP protocol stack.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">22. <i>Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) </i>is a set of security protocols and formats for ensuring secure credit/debit card transactions (also called electronic transactions) on an untrusted network, such as the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">23. <i>Certification Authority (CA) </i>and <i>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) </i>are two important concepts proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). They enable two entities in an open network to exchange public keys securely, when the two entities want to communicate securely using public-key cryptography.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">24. <i>Steganography </i>is a technique of hiding secret messages within the code representing a standard computer file in such a way that normal users cannot make out the difference between a file without the hidden secret message and a file with the hidden secret message. Only communicating entities can make out this difference and extract the hidden secret message from such a file. The file could be that of any media such as word- processed text, static image, audio recording, or video.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">25. <i>Steganalysis  </i>deals  with  techniques  to  determine  whether  a  file  contains  a steganographically-hidden message. It employs mathematical techniques or artificial neural networks to statistically scan digital files and then examine them for changes in pixel values to detect the likely presence of steganographically-hidden data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">26. Some <i>design principles </i>that designers should use as basic guidelines for designing secure systems are least privilege, fail-safe defaults, open design, security built in to the system, checking for current authority, easy to grant and revoke access rights, not to trust other parties, always ensuring freshness of messages, building of firewalls, cost effective, efficient, convenient to use, and right set of trade-offs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">27. <i>Cyber law </i>is a branch of law that deals with legal issues related to the use of computers and information technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">28. <i>Cyber forensics </i>deals with challenges to acquire digital evidences available in cyber crimes, analyze them, and to present them before the court of law in a manner that is acceptable to court for making decisions to prosecute cyber criminals.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">29. CERT stands for Computer Emergency Response Team. It is a nation&#39;s most trusted referral agency for responding to computer security incidents whenever they occur.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part597.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part599.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
