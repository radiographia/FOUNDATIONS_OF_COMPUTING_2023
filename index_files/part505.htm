Hence, organizations operating in almost all domains are aggressively working to implement IoT applications relevant to their domains. However, many of them are still facing several technological challenges in successful implementation of IoT applications. Some of the main challenges faced by them are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Interoperability Issue</b>. IoT applications often use thousands of interconnected “things” (smart devices). With different vendors, OEMs, and service providers supplying these devices and associated software, seamless integration of these heterogeneous devices to create a working system becomes difficult due to interoperability issue. In addition to solving hardware level integration issue of these heterogeneous devices, it is important to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">solve their semantic interoperability issue, so that the interconnected devices can share data and correctly interpret the information for initiating actions accordingly.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Issue of Designing Smart “Things”</b>. IoT applications use “things” (smart devices) for capturing and transmission of data. Often these devices need to be deployed in harsh conditions (high temperature areas, heavy rain regions, heavy snowfall regions, under water, etc.). Moreover, the devices need ultra-low power circuits, so that their power consumption is low and they can work for expected time period without any re-charge. They also need to be equipped with appropriate sensors, storage and networking capabilities. It is always a challenge to manufacture such devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Unstructured Data Handling Issue</b>. The data captured by various types of smart devices in IoT applications is unstructured data, which needs to be cleaned and structured to ensure that only quality data is used for making decisions and taking actions. This is often a challenge because of the volume, velocity and variety of data that needs to be handled. Unclean data when used for analytics could lead to “false positives” or “false negatives”, both of which are unacceptable in trusted systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Security and Privacy Issue</b>. Several organizations are reluctant to adopt IoT due to security and privacy issue. IoT applications often deal with personal information that are automatically captured and communicated by smart devices. Hence, such information falling in unauthorized hands may lead to legal and liability problems. Energy-efficient data encryption and data protection techniques are needed to address this issue.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Reliability Issue</b>. Since IoT systems are designed to work without human intervention, the systems must work reliably. Hence, system availability, robust design of various system components, and automatic failure handling are a few design parameters that need enormous effort to take care of this issue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Researchers across the world are continuously working to address these issues for successful implementation and wide adoption of IoT applications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Points to Remember</h4><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. The <i>Internet </i>is a network of computers, which links many different types of computers all over the world. It is a network of networks sharing a common mechanism for addressing (identifying)  computers,  and  a  common  set  of  communication  protocols  for communications between two computers on the network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Four basic services provided by the Internet to its users are electronic mail, file transfer protocol, telnet, and usenet news.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <i>Electronic mail </i>service (known as <i>e-mail </i>in short) enables an Internet user to send a mail (message) to another Internet user in any part of the world in a near-real-time manner.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <i>File Transfer Protocol </i>service (known as <i>FTP </i>in short) enables an Internet user to move a file from one computer to another on the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <i>Telnet </i>service enables an Internet user to log in to another computer on the Internet from his/her local computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <i>Usenet </i>service enables a group of Internet users to exchange their views/ideas/information on some common topic of interest with all members belonging to the group.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. The WWW uses a concept called hypertext. <i>Hypertext </i>documents on the Internet are known as <i>Web Pages</i>. Web designers create web pages by using a special language called <i>HyperText Markup Language </i>(HTML), which is a powerful language for linking documents for easier electronic access and manipulation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. To use a computer as a web client, a user needs to load on it a special software tool known as <i>WWW browser </i>(or <i>browser </i>in short). Normally, browsers provide several navigation facilities to help users save time while <i>Internet surfing</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. The two commonly used types of browsers are <i>graphical browsers </i>and <i>Java-enabled browsers</i>. As compared to the first generation graphical browsers, Java-enabled browsers support dynamic content, dynamic data types, and dynamic protocols.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">10. <i>Web Services </i>(WS) is a result of convergence of the Web and distributed object technologies. Designers of modern Web-based systems use it extensively for building large Web-based applications for e-commerce, information distribution, entertainment, collaborative working, surveys, and numerous other activities. It allows anyone to create an electronic service and anyone else to use it, thus enabling anyone-to-anyone communications, coordination, and interaction.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. An <i>Internet search engine </i><a href="http://WWW/" class="s23" target="_blank">is an application, which helps users locate websites containing useful information and references to such information on the WWW.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">12. The three major elements of an Internet search engine are search request interface, information discoverer, and presenter of research results.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">13. The four major types of Internet search engines are natural language search engines, subject directories search engines, subject guide search engines, and meta-search engines.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">14. Some  important  uses  of  the  Internet  are  for  online  teaching/learning,  online communication, software sharing, exchange of views on topics of common interest, posting of information of general interest, organization promotion, product promotion and feedback about products, customer support service, online journals and magazines, online shopping, worldwide video conferencing, and worldwide webcasting.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">15. An <i>Intranet </i>is a network that connects the computers and networks of an organization by using hardware and software, which are used on the Internet. Typically, it uses TCP/IP protocols, browser software, and software for servers on the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">16. For security reasons, an organization often uses a <i>proxy server</i>, which is a specially configured computer, which allows other computers of the organization to interact with the Internet through it. When only a single proxy server interacts with the Internet, the organization can easily maintain the security of its computing resources, because it can keep the single proxy server more secure than hundreds of individual computers on a network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">17. <i>Internet telephony </i>refers to use of public Internet for voice transmission. It enables a subscriber of an Internet service to use his/her computer to make long-distance calls.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">18. <i>Microbrowsers </i>are browsers for Internet-enabled mobile devices. They can work with small, resource-restricted hand-held devices (having limited processing and memory resources), but offer reduced functionality than desktop browsers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">19. Next generation Internet Protocol (popularly known as <i>IPV6 </i>) has been developed to address the limitations of the current Internet Protocol (<i>IPV4</i>). The key features of <i>IPV6</i></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">are large address space to ensure that the world will not run out of IP addresses; flow labeling and priority concepts to support real-time services; better security features for secure business transactions; enhanced routing capability to support mobile hosts; provision for anycast addressing; auto-configuration facility; and improved packet header format for more efficient packet handling.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">20. Internet of Things (IoT) is enhanced form of the Internet, in which the enhancement takes care of the following two objectives - (a) Interconnection of things, in addition to computing devices and (b) Automatic collection and transfer of data, without any help from human being.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">21. Some obvious benefits of IoT in all areas of its application are increased accuracy, increased efficiency, reduced wastage and improved customer satisfaction.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">22. Technologists have used IoT in many sectors with millions of applications. A few examples are smart home, smart city, smart healthcare, smart energy management, smart transportation system, smart agriculture/farming and smart manufacturing/industry.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">23. Some of the main challenges being faced currently in successful implementation of IoT applications are interoperability issue; issue of designing smart “things”; unstructured data handling issue, security and privacy issue; and reliability issue.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part504.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part506.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
