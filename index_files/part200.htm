This helps in achieving maximum efficiency of the people working on these machines and protecting them from accidents or medical problems caused due to continuous usage of a machine for long hours. For example, prolonged usage of a badly designed keyboard can cause wrist problems, and that of a badly designed monitor can cause eyesight problems. Hence, manufactures of I/O devices try making ergonomically better devices. A few examples are (there are hundreds of such examples):</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Originally, the keyboard of a computer was attached to its monitor. However, now keyboards are attached to the monitor with a reasonably long cable, which enables a user to move the keyboard to a comfortable position on the table, or to place it on his/her lap during operation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Many new keyboards have tilt adjustments and hand-rest pads to make their use more comfortable for the operators.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3. A cordless mouse is more comfortable to use than a wired mouse.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. A monitor mounted on a ball bearing enables a user to tilt and rotate it to suit his/her comfortable height and angle of operation. Hence, it is more comfortable to use than a monitor fixed at one angle.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Flat-screen monitors have replaced curved-screen monitors because they improve readability and reduce reflections.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. Color monitors have replaced monochrome monitors because they improve readability and are more comfortable to view.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. Higher resolution monitors are preferred because they prevent flicker of displayed objects, which may lead to eye problems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">8. Monitors also use special screen coatings for reducing glare on eyes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part199.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part201.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
