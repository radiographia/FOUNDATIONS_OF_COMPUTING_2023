For example, a user uses it to specify a set of annotations (also called <i>markup conventions</i><a href="part335.htm#bookmark1785" class="s23">) with a text document to indicate what format (such as font type, style, and font size) the user wants to apply to each part of the text document. </a><a href="part335.htm#bookmark1785" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">9.24</span> shows an example. Notice from the figure that markup language instructions (known as <i>tags</i>) are enclosed in angle brackets &lt;like this&gt; in the main text of the text document. The codes h1, p, and em are examples of <i>structural markup instructions</i>. They describe the structure of the text included within them. For example, h1 means, “first level heading”, p means “paragraph”, and em means “emphasized word or phrase”. A program interpreting such structural markup instructions may apply its own rules or styles for presenting the resulting text document when displayed, using different formatting styles (such as font types, font sizes, bold or italic or underline for emphasize, etc.) as desired.</p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="142" alt="image" src="Image_597.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1785">Figure 9.24. </a><span class="s21">An example of markup language usage.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1786">As the example shows, many markup languages enable embedding of markup language instructions in the main text of the text document in the same data stream or file. However, some markup languages allow isolation of markup language instructions from the main text of the text document by using pointers, offsets, identifiers, or other methods to establish coordination between the two.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With the availability of word-processing and document processing software with WYSIWYG (“What You See Is What You Get”) feature, normal users do not use a markup language for preparing text documents. However, users involved in serious publishing work still use markup languages to specify the structure of their text documents.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Originally, users used markup languages for specifying the structure of text documents. However, present day users also use them in other areas, which involve presentation of various types of information including pay lists, vector graphics, web services, user interface, and content publishing. Most of these are applications of a popular markup language called XML (Extensible Markup Language).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A few popular markup languages are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>SGML (Syntax for Generalized Markup Language). </b>SGML is a meta language for markup languages. The idea behind its design was that markup instructions should focus on the structural aspects of a document, while the interpreter should decide the visual presentation of that structure. Hence, it specifies the syntax for including markup instructions in documents and allows authors to create and use any markup instruction they wish, or select tags of their choice (having terminologies of their domain that make the most sense to them).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">International Standards Organization (ISO) standardized and released SGML in 1986. After that, SGML has been widely used for large-scale documentation requirements. Many new markup languages have based their design on SGML. However, SGML is cumbersome and difficult to learn because of the vast features it supports to make it highly flexible.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>TeX and LaTex. </b>TeX was a major publishing standard in 1970s and 80s. Donald Knuth developed it for typesetting documents in scientific disciplines. Hence, it focused on detailed layout of text and font descriptions for typesetting mathematical formulae and equations. It turned out to be a powerful tool for creating professional quality publications in science and engineering domains. However, it was difficult to learn and use by common and casual users. Hence, academia and research communities were its primary users.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">LaTex was later introduced as TeX macro package that provides a descriptive markup system on top of TeX. Hence, it is easier to use as compared to TeX and has a wider user base than TeX.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language). </b>HTML is the most widely used markup language for designing contents for the World Wide Web. It played a major role in the success of the Web because of the flexibility and extensibility that it provided to the web content designers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">HTML was created using SGML syntax and it resembles other SGML-based tag languages. It is also categorized as a <i>container language </i>(one that follows a hierarchical model) because it restricts the placement of tags, requiring them to be nested fully inside other tags, or the root tag of the document.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>XML (eXtensible Markup Language). </b>Researchers developed XML as a simplified form of SGML for creating documents for the Internet (World Wide Web). Like SGML, it is also a meta language and allows users to create any tags needed (hence the name “extensible”) and then describing those tags and their permitted uses.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Existing SGML users and software could easily switch to XML because XML is a subset of SGML. Hence, a user can write an XML document in such a way that it is also an SGML document. This led to easy and quick adoption of XML. Although, the original purpose of XML was to create documents for the Internet, it is widely used now for communicating data between applications. XML users have also developed many XML- based applications, which are in use today. These include Resource Description Framework (RDF), XForms, DocBook, SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1787">5. </a><b>XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) </b>Due to the popularity of XML, all recommendations of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since January 2000 for enhancements in HTML are XML based. XHTML is a result of these extensions in HTML. The language specification requires that XHTML Web documents must be well- formed XML documents. This enables creation of more rigorous and robust Web documents while using tags from HTML.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part334.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part336.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
