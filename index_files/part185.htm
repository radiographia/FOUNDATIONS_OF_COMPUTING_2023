They are broadly classified into two types: general-purpose keyboards and special-purpose keyboards. These two types and some other related concepts are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1234">General-purpose Keyboards</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">General-purpose keyboards are standard keyboards that have enough keys to meet the data entry requirements of a wide range of computer users and applications.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1236"><span><img width="505" height="159" alt="image" src="Image_385.jpg"/></span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1235">Figure 6.1. </a><span class="s21">Layout of keys on a QWERTY keyboard.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">The most popular general-purpose keyboard used today is the 101-keys </span>QWERTY keyboard <a href="part185.htm#bookmark1235" class="s23">(see </a><a href="part185.htm#bookmark1235" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.1</span>)<a href="part185.htm#bookmark1235" class="s23">. It has 101 keys out of which the keys for alphanumeric characters follow the commonly used QWERTY layout. QWERTY layout adopts the standard typewriter keyboard layout, in which the positioning of character keys ensures faster typing speed. This layout organizes alphabetic keys so that the upper-left row of letters begins with the six letters Q, W, E, R, T, and Y (see </a><a href="part185.htm#bookmark1235" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.1</span><span class="p">).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A QWERTY keyboard groups the keys into the following functional groups:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Alphanumeric keys. </b>This group has the keys for the letters of English alphabet, the numbers 0 to 9, and several special characters such as /, ?, $, &amp;, @, whose arrangement follows QWERTY layout.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Numeric keypad. </b><a href="part185.htm#bookmark1235" class="s23">Numeric keypad, located on the right side of the keyboard, has the keys for the ten digits and mathematical operators (+, -, * and /). Notice from </a><a href="part185.htm#bookmark1235" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.1</span> that these keys are also present in the set of alphanumeric keys, making the numeric keypad redundant. Although redundant, the numeric keypad permits rapid entry of numeric data. Keyboards of portable PCs (laptops) do not have numeric keypad due to space limitation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Arrow keys. </b>These are a set of four keys - up (), down (¯), left (¬) and right (®), which allow us to move the cursor up and down (usually a line at a time), and left and right (usually a character at a time). A cursor, which usually appears as an underscore (_), a vertical line (|), or a rectangle (<span><img width="16" height="13" alt="image" src="Image_386.jpg"/></span>) on the terminal screen, always indicates the location of the next keyed-in character on the screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These keys are also used for vertical scrolling (using up and down keys) and horizontal scrolling (using left and right keys) of the contents displayed on the terminal screen, when a displayed document or worksheet extends beyond the size of the terminal screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4. <a href="part185.htm#bookmark1237" class="s39">Special function keys. </a><span class="s46">Figure 6.2</span> lists some of the important keys that belong to this set.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Other function keys. </b>These are user-programmable keys labeled as F1, F2, F3, and so on. The function assigned to each of these keys is different for different software packages. For example, a word processing program can use F1, F2 and F3 keys to make the selected text underlined, italic, and bold, respectively. These keys are also known as <i>soft keys </i>because their functionalities are software definable.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1238"><span><img width="471" height="483" alt="image" src="Image_387.jpg"/></span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1237">Figure 6.2. </a><span class="s21">Some special function keys on a QWERTY keyboard and their functions.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Special-purpose Keyboards</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Computer systems used for special-purpose applications often use special-purpose keyboards to enable faster data entry and rapid interaction with the system because their data entry requirements may not be as versatile as general-purpose computer systems. For example, a bank ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) uses a simple keyboard with only a few keys, which are sufficient for financial transactions by customers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Foreign Language Keyboards</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Several countries have designed special keyboards for data entry in their local languages. Some of these keyboards have a large number of keys and use a coding scheme with more bits to accommodate the large number of characters used in the language. For example, QWERTY keyboards work with an 8-bit coding scheme, which can accommodate 2<span class="s22">8 </span>= 256 different characters. However, Japanese language keyboards work with a 16-bit coding scheme to accommodate all characters used in Japanese language.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Keyboard Templates</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We saw that the function assigned to the function keys F1 to F12 and to some of the special function keys depends on the software used. When different software packages program the same keys to perform different functions, it becomes difficult for a user using multiple software to remember the functions assigned to different keys by different software. Hence, several software vendors distribute their software packages with keyboard templates that designate assignment of various commands to function keys. These templates, made of plastic, nicely fit over the keyboard. The functionality of various function keys is written on top of the plastic at the positions of those function keys. With this, a user need not remember the functions assigned to different keys by different software packages.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Software Simulated Keys</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We often come across the situation of entering a non-standard character such as “a” or “±”, or a phrase or name such as “Prentice-Hall of India” repeatedly while preparing a document. For faster data entry, a user may reassign a keyboard key to produce them. For example, a user may write software to reassign the character “#” to the name “Prentice-Hall of India” so that the system automatically enters “Prentice-Hall of India” in place of the character # whenever this key is pressed. Such arrangements of making a key produce something different from what it is supposed to produce is known as software simulation of the key.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Autorepeat Feature</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If a user keeps a key pressed for an auto-repeat initial delay period (usually of the order of 300 milliseconds), its corresponding character, or functionality starts auto-repeating. For example, if the user keeps the key with character “a” pressed, the characters “aaaaa…..” start appearing on the terminal screen till he/she stops pressing it. This feature enables faster data entry when the user wants to enter the same character multiple times, or when he/she wants to skip multiple lines or pages.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Keyboard Buffer</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A keyboard buffer is a small memory inside either the terminal or the keyboard. It temporarily stores keyboard input data before transferring it to the computer&#39;s main memory for processing. It has the capacity to store a few tens to a few hundreds of keystrokes. Storing of keystrokes in keyboard buffer instead of sending them directly to main memory makes user interaction with the system more efficient and smooth. This is because when a user presses a key, the processor may be busy doing something else and may not be in a position to transfer the keyboard input to main memory immediately. In this case, in a system without keyboard buffer, the system locks the keyboard after every keystroke, not allowing the user to enter anything until the system completes transferring the keyboard input to main memory, and releases the lock. This causes inconvenience and delay in data entry, especially for operators with fast typing speeds. Keyboard buffer helps users to enter keyboard inputs at their own convenient speeds because the input data is temporarily stored in the keyboard buffer and the processor keeps transferring them to the main memory whenever it finds time to attend to the keyboard device.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part184.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part186.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
