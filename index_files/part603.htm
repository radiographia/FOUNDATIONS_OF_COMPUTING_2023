Hence, it improves both internal operations of a government and services offered by the government to its citizens. In turn, it contributes to the creation of an ideal environment to support the growth of an entire nation. The main benefits of e-governance are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Integrated information. </b>E-governance targets to use a government-wide electronic information infrastructure to simplify service delivery, reduce duplication, and improve the level and speed of service to clients at a lower cost. It recommends creating, managing, and prudently sharing information electronically among various government departments and different services that they offer. That is, it captures some information only once, as close to its source as possible, and then enables its sharing and reuse with all</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">authorized users. This avoids requesting for and manual transcription and re-entering of the same information repeatedly, whenever a citizen goes to a new government department for some services.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Integrated services. </b>The integrated information approach enables offering of integrated services. That is, people can avail at one place different types of services such as payment of taxes, issue of licenses, receiving of grants, etc., which usually different government departments offer. This makes citizens perceive a government as a single body to interact with, instead of a number of unrelated entities operating at different locations in different government buildings. This, in turn, simplifies interaction between the government and its people.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Anywhere services. </b>E-governance provides interactive online services. With online accessibility of stored information from remote locations, government officials can serve any citizen from a government office located in any part of the state or country. Hence, an individual need not travel all the way to a particular government office, which offers the desired service. He/she can get the service from a local government office.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Anywhere, anytime information. </b>Delivery of services usually requires interaction between government officials and citizens, but citizens should have access to public- domain information without any interaction with a government office. With e-governance facilities, citizens can obtain information related to government processes and procedures through an online system without interacting with any government official. In fact, e- governance enables quick, interactive access to a vast array of information, through computers at home, or work, or through kiosks in convenient public locations. Because citizens can access such information from any convenient location at any convenient time, there is no pressure on them to visit a government office physically during office hours.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Improved productivity. </b>E-governance improves productivity of both government officials and citizens. For example:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. Government officials can interact faster with the use of electronic mail instead of paper files and letters.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. Workflow of internal government administrative processes such as procurement, recruitment, evaluation, budgeting, planning, etc. become much more streamlined and efficient with e-governance.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">c. Citizens save their valuable time because of the facility of anytime, anywhere services and information.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Better decision making and planning. </b>The integrated information base of e-governance helps planners and decision makers perform extensive analysis of stored data to provide answers to queries of administrative cadre. With this tool, they can now formulate more effective strategies and policies for citizen facilitation by accessing their impact over intended sections of population.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Better protection and security of information. </b>Instead of keeping valuable information in paper files with duplicate information in multiple government offices located at different places, e-governance keeps all information in electronic form at one place by using integrated information approach. This helps in keeping the information secured against theft or leakage. Moreover, proper backup mechanisms help in protecting the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">information against loss due to natural calamities such as fires, earthquakes, and floods.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part602.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part604.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
