We have already seen how to represent a Boolean function in the form of a truth table or in canonical forms - sum- of-products and product-of-sums. We will now see how to represent a Boolean function in the form of a K-map.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What is K-map?</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part72.htm#bookmark852" class="s23">K-map is a pictorial representation of a Boolean function.

Each square </a>is assigned a minterm number as shown in the figure. Notice that minterm numbers are assigned in such a manner that the binary equivalent of minterm numbers of adjacent squares differ by one bit only. For example, notice that in case of four-variable map, the squares in the first column are assigned the minterm numbers 0, 1, 3, 2 from top to bottom instead of 0, 1, 2, 3. This is because binary equivalent of numbers 1 (0001) and 2 (0010) differ by two bits, but binary equivalent of numbers 1 (0001) and 3 (0011) as well as 3 (0011) and 2 (0010) differ by one bit only.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The variable names (A, B, C, D) of the Boolean function are listed across both sides of the diagonal line in the upper left hand corner of the map. The 0s and 1s marked along each row and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">each column designate the value of the corresponding variables for the squares in that row or column. Additionally, the rows and columns are divided into sets (non-disjoint) marked by curly brackets and each set is designated by one of the variables of the Boolean function. Notice that each variable associated with such a set of squares (written on the curly brackets) contains half of the squares in the map where that variable appears uncomplemented. The variable appears complemented in the remaining half of the squares.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="452" height="597" alt="image" src="Image_199.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark852">Figure 3.13. </a><span class="s21">Maps for two-, three-, and four-variable Boolean functions.

For example, in the three-variable map, the binary values of the variables corresponding</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to the last square (last row, last column) are A = 1, B = 0 and C = 1.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hence, the minterm represented by the square is A<span><img width="11" height="14" alt="image" src="Image_200.jpg"/></span>C, and this is the reason why the square is assigned the minterm number 5 (decimal equivalent of binary 101). Similarly, in the four- variable map, the minterm represented by the square having number 13 is A<span><img width="11" height="14" alt="image" src="Image_201.jpg"/></span>CD because the binary values of the variables corresponding to that square are A = 1, B = 1, C = 0 and D = 1.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark853">Adjacent Squares in K-map</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Minimization of Boolean functions by map simplification deals with grouping adjacent squares that contain 1s. For doing this, it is important to understand the definition of adjacency of squares in K-maps, which is as follows:</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Any two squares whose binary values of minterms differ by a single bit are adjacent.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">According to this definition, the following squares are adjacent:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. The square to the immediate left of a square (for example, square 3 is adjacent to 7)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. The square to the immediate right of a square (for example, square 6 is adjacent to 2)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. The square immediately above a square (for example, square 4 is adjacent to 5)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. The square immediately below a square (for example, square 1 is adjacent to 0)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">5. The squares at the extreme ends of the same horizontal row (for example, in three-variable map, square 0 is adjacent to 4 and square 1 is adjacent to 5)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">6. The squares at the top and bottom of the same column (for example, in four-variable map, 0 and 2, 4 and 6, 12 and 14, and 8 and 10 are adjacent)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">7. The four corner squares (for example, in three-variable map, 0-1-4-5 are adjacent, and in four-variable map, 0-2-8-10 are adjacent)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Obtaining Simplified Boolean Function with a K-map</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following procedure is used to obtain a simplified Boolean function with a K-map:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Draw an n-variable K-map depending on the number of variables ( <i>n</i>) in the given Boolean function.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. From the truth table of the given Boolean function, insert 1s in those squares of the map whose corresponding minterms are 1.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Combine the squares containing 1s in groups of adjacent squares. These groups must contain a number of squares that is an integral power of 2. The groups are not disjoint sets of squares in the sense that one or more squares of a group may also belong to another group.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Each group of squares represents an algebraic term. All these terms are ORed to obtain the simplified algebraic expression of the given Boolean function.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following examples illustrate the procedure.</p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="169" alt="image" src="Image_202.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="562" height="830" alt="image" src="Image_203.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark854"><span><img width="499" height="707" alt="image" src="Image_204.jpg"/></span></a></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark855"><span><img width="480" height="386" alt="image" src="Image_205.jpg"/></span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Product-of-Sums Simplification</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have seen how to simplify Boolean functions expressed in sum-of-products form by using K- maps. We will now see how to simplify functions expressed in product-of-sums form by using K-maps. The following procedure is used:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Draw an n-variable K-map depending on the number of variables ( <i>n</i>) in the given Boolean function.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. From the truth table of the given Boolean function, insert 0s in those squares of the map whose corresponding maxterms are 1 (which is the same as corresponding minterms being 0).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Combine the squares containing 0s in groups of adjacent squares. These groups must contain a number of squares that is an integral power of 2. The groups are not disjoint sets of squares in the sense that one or more squares of a group may also belong to another group.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Each group of squares represents an algebraic term, which are ORed to obtain the simplified complemented function.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Take the complement of the function obtained in Step 4 to obtain the simplified function in product-of-sums form.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Example 3.11 illustrates the procedure.</p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark856"><span><img width="480" height="457" alt="image" src="Image_206.jpg"/></span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Don&#39;t Care Conditions</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When representing a Boolean function as a truth table, we have seen until now that the output values for each of the 2<span class="s22">n </span>combinations (minterms) of the <i>n </i>variables are either 0 or 1. There are occasions when it does not matter if the function produces an output of 0 or 1 for a given minterm. Such minterms are called don&#39;t-care conditions because we do not care whether the function&#39;s output is 0 or 1. Squares in a K-map corresponding to such minterms are marked with a cross mark (X). During simplification of the function, these squares are used as follows in the map:</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. While making groups of adjacent squares, the Xs may be assumed to be either 0 or 1, whichever gives the simplest expression. That is, it can be grouped with squares having 1s (when dealing with sum-of-products simplification) or squares having 0s (when dealing with product-of-sums simplification), if its inclusion in the group gives a simpler expression.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. An ‘X’ need not be included in any group if it does not contribute to the simplification of the function.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In short, the choice of including a square containing ‘X’ in a group is optional and depends only on its contribution to the simplification of the function. The example here illustrates this.</p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="341" alt="image" src="Image_207.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Note that don&#39;t care minterm 3 was not included in any group because it does not contribute to the simplification of the function. Also note that if the don&#39;t care minterms 2 and 6 were not included in the group of four adjacent squares, the minterms 0 and 4 would have formed a group of two adjacent squares, representing an algebraic term BC . Hence, the simplified expression for the function in this case would have been</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 208pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="86" height="14" alt="image" src="Image_208.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This form of the function is not as simplified as the expression obtained previously. Hence, choosing to include the don&#39;t-care minterms 2 and 6 in group formation produces the simplest Boolean expression.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part71.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part73.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
