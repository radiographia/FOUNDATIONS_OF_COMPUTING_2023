To handle this process and to speed up the rate of information transfer, the CPU uses a number of special memory units called <i>registers </i>. These registers hold information on a temporary basis and are part of CPU (not main memory).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Length of a register is equal to the number of bits it can store. Hence, we refer to a register that can store 8 bits as an 8-bit register. Most CPUs sold today have 32-bit, 64-bit or 128-bit registers. The length of registers of a computer is sometimes called its <i>word size. </i>The bigger the word size, the faster a computer can process a set of data. With all other parameters being same, a CPU with 32-bit registers can process data twice as large as one with 16-bit registers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although, the number of registers varies from computer to computer, there are some registers common to all computers. Functions of these registers are described here. Each of these registers possesses the ability to receive information, hold it temporarily, and pass it on as directed by the control unit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark965">1. </a><b>Memory Address Register (MAR). </b>It holds the address of the active memory location. It is loaded from program control register when the system reads an instruction from memory.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Memory Buffer Register (MBR). </b>It holds the contents of the accessed (read/written) memory word. The system transfers an instruction word placed in this register to instruction register. A data word placed in this register is accessible for operation with accumulator register or for transfer to I/O register. To store a word in a memory location, the system first transfers it to MBR and then writes it in memory from MBR.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Program Control register (PC). </b>It holds the address of the next instruction for execution. Normally, a system stores instructions of a program in consecutive memory locations, and executes them in sequence unless it encounters a branch instruction. A <i>branch instruction </i>is an operation that causes a transfer to a non-consecutive instruction. The system transfers address part of a branch instruction to PC register so that it becomes the address of the next instruction.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Accumulator register (A). </b>It holds the data on which the system has to operate, intermediate results, and results of operations performed. The system uses it during the execution of most instructions. The system returns the result of an arithmetic operation to accumulator register for transfer to main memory through memory buffer register. Many computers have more than one accumulator registers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Instruction register (I). </b><a href="part305.htm#bookmark1708" class="s23">It holds the current instruction under execution. As soon as the instruction is stored in this register, its operation and address parts (see </a><a href="part305.htm#bookmark1708" class="s3">Chapter </a><span class="s46">9</span>) are separated. The system sends the address part of the instruction to MAR, while it sends operation part to control unit, where it is decoded and interpreted. Finally, the control unit generates and sends command signals to the appropriate unit for carrying out the task specified in the instruction.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Input/Output register (I/O). </b>The system uses it to communicate with input/output devices. An input device transfers all input information (such as instructions and data) to this register. Similarly, the system transfers all output information to this register and an output device picks up data for output from here.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 4.3<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">summarizes the functions of these registers.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="448" height="164" alt="image" src="Image_309.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark966">Figure 4.3. </a><span class="s21">Functions of various registers.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Execution of an instruction by the CPU during program execution normally involves the following steps:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. The control unit takes the address of the next program instruction for execution from program control register and reads the instruction from corresponding memory address into the instruction register of control unit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. The control unit then sends the operation and address parts of the instruction to the decoder and memory address register, respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark967">3. The decoder interprets the instruction and accordingly the control unit sends command signals to the appropriate unit for carrying out the task specified in the instruction. For example, if it is an arithmetic or logic operation, the control unit sends signal to ALU. In this case, the control unit also ensures that the data corresponding to the address part of the instruction is loaded in a suitable register in ALU, before it sends the signal to ALU. The ALU performs the operation on the data and signals the control unit as soon as it has finished.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. As the system executes each instruction, it loads the address of the next instruction for execution in program control register, and repeats Steps 1 to 4.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part104.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part106.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
