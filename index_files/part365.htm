Normally, computer systems support the following two file access methods at operating system level:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Sequential access files. </b>Normally, operating systems use sequential access files for storage of files on sequential access storage media, such as magnetic tape. Applications can access the contents of a sequential access file only sequentially. That is, a process can read the bytes or records in the file in the order in which they are stored, starting at the beginning. Reading of bytes or records randomly or out of order is not possible. An application can, however, rewind and read a sequential access file as often as needed.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Random access files</b>. Normally, operating systems use random access files for storage of files on random access storage media, such as magnetic or optical disks. Applications can access the contents of a random access file randomly, irrespective of the order in which the bytes or records are stored. For example, an application can access a specific byte/record of the file directly without reading all bytes/records before it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Random access files are essential for many applications. For example, a railway reservation system may be storing information about all tickets booked for a particular train in a single file. If a customer wants to cancel an already booked seat, reservation program must be able to access the specific record for that seat without having to read records for hundreds of other booked seats first, so that booking service can be fast enough.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1927">Not all operating systems support both sequential and random access files. Some support only sequential access files, some support only random access files, while there are some, which support both. Those, which support files of both types, normally require the creator of a file to declare it as sequential or random when he/she/it creates the file. Users can access the file only in a manner consistent with its declaration. Most modern operating systems support random access files only.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part364.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part366.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
