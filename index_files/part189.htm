An electronic-card reader, normally connected to a computer, reads the data encoded on an electronic card and transfers it to the computer for further processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Banks issue electronic cards to their customers for use with <i>automatic teller machines </i>(<i>ATMs</i>). An ATM is an unattended machine connected to a bank&#39;s computer, which allows a customer to perform certain bank transactions 24 hours a day, without the need to interact with a bank employee. An electronic card for use in an ATM has its customer&#39;s account number and credit limit (maximum amount that he/she can withdraw in a day) encoded on the card. When a customer inserts his/her card into the ATM (actually the electronic-card reader of the ATM), the reader reads the data encoded on the card and transmits it to the bank&#39;s computer activating the customer&#39;s account. The customer then carries out the desired transaction by following the instructions displayed on the screen of the ATM and by pressing a few keys on its customized keyboard or touch screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many organizations also use electronic cards for controlling access to physically secured areas. In this case, an organization issues an electronic card to each employee with his/her authorization data encoded on it. Authorization data specifies which employee has access to which areas. All physically secured areas of the organization have an electronic-card reader installed at its entrance. When an employee wants to enter into a physically secured area, he/she inserts his/her electronic card into the reader installed at the entrance of that area. If the electronic card and its reader use RFID technology, a user simply needs to flash his/her electronic card near the reader instead of inserting it into the reader. The reader reads and checks the authorization data encoded on the card before permitting the individual to enter the area (the door has electronic connection with the reader and opens only if the reader finds that the individual has authorization to access the area). In such applications, a central computer having link to the electronic-card reader maintains a record of the identity and time of people entering/leaving a secured area. In case of security breaches, an organization uses this record to trace the problem.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Depending on the manner in which data is encoded, electronic cards are of the following types:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Magnetic strip cards. </b>These cards have a magnetic strip on which encoded data is stored. It can contain much more data per unit of space than do printed characters or bar codes. Moreover, we cannot read data stored in it visually. Many organizations issue magnetic strip cards to their employees or customers with their confidential data stored on it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1267">2. </a><b>Smart cards. </b>Smart cards have a built-in microprocessor chip in whose memory the encoded data is stored. It can store much more data than the magnetic strip of a magnetic strip card. A smart card also has some processing capability because its microprocessor has its own processor and memory. This feature attributes intelligence to smart cards and makes them more suitable for a wider variety of applications than magnetic strip cards. For example, a smart card can be used as an electronic wallet by storing a specific amount of cash in the microprocessor chip before the card is issued to a customer. Whenever the customer uses the card to make purchases, the amount of purchase made at every instance is deducted from the balance amount stored in the card by inserting the card in a card read/write machine (also called electronic registers), which is available with shops that allow use of smart cards for making purchases. At any time, the customer can pay additional money to the card company and get the balance amount stored in the card increased. Because smart cards can hold more information, have some processing capability, and is almost impossible to duplicate, they are fast replacing magnetic strip cards.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part188.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part190.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
