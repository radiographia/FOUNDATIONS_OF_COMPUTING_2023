It is stated normally in terms of<i>kilobytes </i>(<i>KB</i>), which is equal to 1024 (2 <span class="s22">10</span>) bytes of storage, or <i>megabytes </i>(<i>MB</i>), which is equal to 1,048,576 (2<span class="s22">20</span>) bytes of storage, or<i>gigabytes </i>(<i>GB</i>), which is equal to 1,073,741,824 (2 <span class="s22">30</span>) bytes of storage. Therefore, a computer having 2 GB of memory is capable of storing 2 x 1073741824 = 2,147,483,648 bytes or characters. Notice that 1 KB is about 10<span class="s22">3 </span>bytes, 1 MB is about 10<span class="s22">6 </span>bytes, and 1 GB is about 10<span class="s22">9 </span>bytes hence, the origin of the prefixes <i>kilo </i>(thousand), <i>mega </i>(million) and <i>giga </i>(billion).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sometimes, we also state memory capacity of a computer system in terms of number of words. In this case, we specify total number of bits per word along with total number of words. Therefore, a memory having 2 <span class="s22">15 </span>words with each word of 16 bits is called a “32 K, 16-bit memory”. If word size of a memory is 8 bits (equal to a byte), it becomes immaterial whether memory capacity is expressed in terms of bytes or words. Hence, a memory having 2<span class="s22">16 </span>words with each word of 8 bits is simply referred to as a 64 K memory (word size of 8-bits is implicit here).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Memory capacity continues to increase rapidly and it is only a matter of time before we start stating memory capacity in terms of <i>terabytes (TB)</i>, which is about one trillion (10<span class="s22">12</span>) bytes. Today, we frequently use GB, TB and PB (petabytes = 10 <span class="s22">15 </span>bytes) to refer to the capacity of secondary storage of computer systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part110.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part112.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
