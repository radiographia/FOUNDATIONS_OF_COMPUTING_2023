Researchers introduced SCSI (pronounced “scuzzy”) interface as an interesting variation of the separate device controller for each device type idea. It uses a generic device controller (called SCSI controller) on a computer system and allows any device having SCSI interface to connect directly to the SCSI bus of the SCSI controller. SCSI interface of a device contains all circuitry that the device needs to operate with the computer system.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part161.htm#bookmark1168" class="s23">As </a><a href="part161.htm#bookmark1168" class="s3">Figure </a>5.27<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows, a SCSI controller connects to a computer bus on one side and controls another bus (called SCSI bus) on the other side. Either the controller is a card that we can plug into an available slot, or it is inbuilt into the computer&#39;s motherboard. The SCSI bus is a bus designed for connecting devices to a computer in a uniform way. In effect, the SCSI controller extends the computer&#39;s bus outside the main system box and enables connection of other devices to the computer with the help of this extended bus. There is a standard protocol for sending device control messages and data on the SCSI bus. Each device connected to the SCSI bus has a standard SCSI interface (a single chip) that knows about the bus protocol.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part161.htm#bookmark1168" class="s23">Since SCSI extends a computer&#39;s bus outside the main computer box, it enables connection of any SCSI device to the computer without the need to open the computer box and install a device controller on its internal bus. A SCSI being an extension of a computer&#39;s bus, it can accommodate multiple devices simultaneously. Most current implementations of SCSI limit the number of devices to sixteen on a given chain due to bus capacity limitation. Moreover, SCSI being an extension of the bus, any type of device (hard-disk drive, optical-disk drive, tape drive, printer, plotter, scanner, etc.) can be linked (or daisy-chained) on a single SCSI port (see </a><a href="part161.htm#bookmark1168" class="s3">Figure</a><a href="part161.htm#bookmark1168" class="s24"> </a><a href="part161.htm#bookmark1168" class="s3">5.27</a><a href="part161.htm#bookmark1168" class="s23">).</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Each SCSI device on a SCSI bus must have a unique identifier (ID) so that the controller can send an I/O request to the appropriate device. If a SCSI bus supports sixteen devices, their IDs range from zero to 15. The SCSI controller itself uses one of the IDs, typically the highest one, leaving room for 15 other devices on the bus.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Introduced in 1981, there have been eight generations of SCSI namely, SCSI-1, SCSI-2, SCSI-3,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ultra SCSI, Ultra2 SCSI, Ultra160 SCSI, Ultra320 SCSI, and Ultra640 SCSI. All these SCSI standards are backward compatible. This has provided SCSI users the utmost in flexibility and has helped to maintain SCSI&#39;s affordability. Ultra640 SCSI, the current SCSI, is the most robust and powerful I/O enterprise solution available today. It allows data to transfer safely and reliably at 640 Mbytes/second.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="461" height="272" alt="image" src="Image_374.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1168">Figure 5.27. </a><span class="s21">SCSI drive interface standard.</span><a name="bookmark1169">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As the name implies, SCSI started out as a standard interface for connecting devices to small computer systems. However, the advantages of a common interface soon became apparent in all sizes of systems. Today, SCSI commands a substantial presence in both the desktop and server systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part160.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part162.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
