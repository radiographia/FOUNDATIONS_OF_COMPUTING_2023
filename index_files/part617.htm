Sinha</b></i>, the main author of this book, has been associated with our publication house for more than thirty-five years. During this period, I have seen him grow from strength-to-strength in the computing field. This is also reflected by the recognitions that various national and international professional bodies have conferred upon him for his contributions to the computing field. For example:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. In 2009, the <b>Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</b>, New York, USA conferred upon him the recognition of <b>“ACM Distinguished Engineer” </b><a href="http://www.acm.org/" class="s23" target="_blank">for his contributions to both the practical and theoretical aspects of Computing and Information Technology. ACM confers this recognition to members who have demonstrated creativity, leadership, and dedication to computing and computer science. ACM ( </a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">www.acm.org</span>) is the world&#39;s largest educational and scientific computing society, which strengthens the computing profession&#39;s collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. In 2012, the <b>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</b>, New York, USA conferred upon him the recognition of <b>“IEEE Fellow” </b><a href="http://www.ieee.org/" class="s23" target="_blank">for his leadership in distributed and parallel processing systems. IEEE Fellow is a distinction reserved for select IEEE members who have extraordinary accomplishments in any of the IEEE fields of interest. IEEE ( </a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">www.ieee.org</span>) is the world&#39;s largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. In 2017, Dr. Sinha was awarded the <b>“Fellowship of Computer Society of India (CSI)” </b>in recognition of his contributions to the society and for his boundless effort for the growth and betterment of IT fraternity.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. In 2022, the <b>Society for Data Science (S4DS) </b>conferred upon him the <b>“Lifetime Achievement Award” </b>for being among the select list of peerless scientists who have dedicated their lives for advancing science and technology for the betterment of society.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dr. Sinha is the recipient of several other awards and recognitions for his contributions to the field of Computer Science &amp; Engineering. I have reproduced overleaf a few news articles covering some of the recognitions of Dr. Sinha. I am sure you will greatly benefit from this and other books authored by such an authority in Computer Science.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">January, 2023</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Manish Jain</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">BPB Publications</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part616.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
