We explain here how directories help in achieving these objectives.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Directory Contents</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part368.htm#bookmark1934" class="s23">A directory has a number of entries, one per file. As </a><a href="part368.htm#bookmark1934" class="s3">Figure </a>10.23<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows, each entry contains a file name, the attributes of the file or pointer to the data structure containing the attributes, and pointer to the file data (disk address where the file data is stored).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When a user creates a new file, the operating system creates an entry for it in the directory. When the user deletes the file, the operating system deletes its corresponding entry from the directory. When a user opens an existing file for use, the operating system searches its corresponding entry in the directory and then extracts its attributes and disk addresses, and loads them in a table in main memory. All subsequent references to the file use this information in main memory.</p><p style="padding-left: 128pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="298" height="119" alt="image" src="Image_631.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1934">Figure 10.23. </a><span class="s21">Typical contents of a directory.

Normally, operating systems use the following types of directory organizations:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Single directory. </b><a href="part368.htm#bookmark1936" class="s23">This is the simplest organization. As </a><a href="part368.htm#bookmark1936" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">10.24</span>(a) shows, in this case, a single directory contains entries for all files in the system. Although this organization is simple to implement, it has significant limitations when the number of files increases or when there are multiple users. As the number of files increases, it becomes difficult for a user to remember the names of all the files in order to create new files with unique names. Similarly, in a system having multiple users, if two users choose the same file name, the system will not accept the file name of the user who did so later than the other user because this violates the unique-name rule. Such conflicts and confusions make this directory organization unsuitable for multi-user systems. Hence, only the most primitive  microcomputer  operating  systems  use  this  directory  organization.  This organization is known as <i>flat directory structure</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="508" height="644" alt="image" src="Image_632.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1936">Figure 10.24. </a><span class="s21">The three types of directory organizations.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1937">2. </a><b>One directory per user. </b><a href="part368.htm#bookmark1936" class="s23">As </a><a href="part368.htm#bookmark1936" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">10.24</span>(b) shows, in this organization, there is a separate directory for each user. A user&#39;s directory contains the names and other attributes of all his/her files. As a file name needs to be unique only within a directory, different users can have files with the same name. This overcomes the limitation of file name conflicts among users in case of single directory organization. However, this organization is inconvenient to use for users with many files because it is difficult for a user to remember the names of a large number of files that he/she creates over a period. This organization is known as <i>two-level directory structure</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Multiple directories per user. </b><a href="part368.htm#bookmark1936" class="s23">As </a><span class="s46">Figure 10.24</span>(c) shows, in this organization also, there</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">is a separate directory for each user. However, each user can create and use as many sub- directories or sub-sub-directories, or sub-sub-sub-directories, and so on to group his/her files in natural ways. For example, a user may like to group his/her files project-wise, in which case he/she creates a sub-directory for each project and keeps all files of a project in that project&#39;s sub-directory. As the operating system requires a file name to be unique only within a directory, a user can have files with the same name in different sub- directories. This feature provides greater flexibility to a user in naming files because the user can group his/her files in logical ways. With this grouping arrangement, the user can easily remember a file name (with reference to its group) even when the number of files for the user becomes large. This organization is known as <i>tree-structured </i>or <i>hierarchical directory structure</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part367.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part369.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
