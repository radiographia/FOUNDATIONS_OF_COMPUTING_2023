Many organizations</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">use multimedia applications for a variety of purposes. Few examples of multimedia applications in corporate sector are as follows.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Multimedia Presentation</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Business promotion often requires a company to make presentations to its prospective customers about its products and services. Normally, a company&#39;s representative makes a presentation at the company&#39;s own premise, at a customer&#39;s premise, or at an exhibition/conference site. Nowadays, companies use multimedia computer systems for this purpose because multimedia makes a presentation more lively and interesting to the audience. Moreover, the representative can easily make changes in an existing presentation to customize it for a specific customer or a specific group of prospective customers. Laptop computers further facilitate in this process because they enable a mobile marketing agent to make presentations at locations other than the company&#39;s own premise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Multimedia Catalogue</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Nowadays, companies use multimedia brochures and catalogues for sales promotion and marketing. For example, many real estate firms use multimedia information to show available houses to a prospective customer without making physical sites visits. Such an application quickly searches a few houses from a database of many houses that closely match the customer&#39;s requirements. It then displays high-quality graphic images of each selected house, with room photographs, layouts, and maps to facilitate the customer to make better and faster decision. Although the firm can provide the same information on paper, the computerized application with added capabilities enable the firm to do better business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Multimedia Kiosk</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A multimedia kiosk has a touch-screen monitor with a user-friendly graphical user interface for ease of operation by public. Multimedia kiosks in public places serve as un-attended information providers, in place of help desks with an attendant. For example, a multimedia kiosk at a city airport might provide the travelers with information on tourist attractions in the city, restaurants, and hotels, along with graphic images and maps showing how to get there. Similarly, a kiosk at a large museum might provide the visitors with information on what types of displays are in which parts of the museum, and a kiosk at a cosmetic counter in a supermarket might provide the customers with information on makeup for particular skin types and colors. Organizations often use multimedia kiosks for such purposes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2419">Animated Advertisements</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For sales promotion, companies often advertise their products and services on television. These advertisements often use computer animation to communicate the usefulness of products or services. For example, if you carefully watch advertisements for soaps, powders, toothpastes, insecticides for mosquitoes and cockroaches, etc., you will see few scenes in them that are not possible to videograph. Creators of these scenes use computer animation.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Virtual Shops and Shopping Malls</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Today, several organizations host virtual shops on their websites, and they offer online shopping (also called <i>e-commerce</i>) facility for their products and services. A virtual shop remains open 24 hours and allows customers to make purchases at the time they wish, without leaving the comfort of their homes. It uses a server, which has multimedia description of all products on sale in the shop. A customer can obtain online information about a product, and can even place order and make online payment for it. The system records the order and the shop owner delivers the product to the customer by courier service.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some organizations use virtual reality technology to extend the concept of virtual shops to virtual shopping malls. A virtual shopping mall presents a virtual shopping street to a customer on his/her computer/TV screen with many different types of shops on both sides of the street. Using interactive features of the system, the customer can enjoy a virtual walkthrough on the shopping street, enter any shop of his/her choice, have a closer look at the products in it, make purchases in the shop, then get back on the street, enter another shop and make purchases there, and so on. With this facility, a customer sitting in his/her house in India can virtually roam around in a shopping street in Japan and can make purchases from the shops in that street.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Multimedia Conferencing</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia conferencing, also known as <i>video conferencing</i>, refers to a system that simulates face-to-face interactions among participating users, located far apart, as if they were sitting and discussing in the same room. The system has a set of high-quality audio-visual equipment consisting of video camera, mike, speaker, and multi-window display screen at each user location. A high-bandwidth network interconnects the equipment at all users&#39; locations. The network transmits audio, video, and other data in point-to-multipoint mode (any-to-all mode) enabling the users to see and hear each other using the audio-visual equipment at their locations. Coordination support software coordinates proceeds of the conference, and resolves any conflicts when multiple users want to communicate simultaneously. Today, many organizations make extensive use of video-conferencing facility to cut down the time and cost involved in traveling of multiple members for face-to-face meetings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part518.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part520.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
