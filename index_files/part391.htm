Apple&#39;s main focus in designing Mac OS was to develop an operating system with powerful ‘ease of use’ feature to enable much easier use of computer systems. To meet this objective, it introduced the idea of GUI (Graphical User Interface), which was later adopted by almost all OS designers for their operating systems. Before this, all operating systems supported only CLI (Command Line Interface).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In 2001, Apple released an upgraded version of Mac OS with many new features, which it named Mac OS X. This version was a total redesign of the earlier version. It ran on a UNIX</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">kernel and had advanced features for memory protection, preemptive multitasking, elegant user interface, automated backup, Internet access, and file sharing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Starting from 2007, Apple launched its mobile devices like iPhone (smart phone), iPad (tablet computer) and iPod (digital music system). For these devices, it designed iOS (described later) and released another upgraded version of Mac OS X. This upgraded version had several new features to enable users to share data among all types of Apple devices (personal computer, laptop, smart phone, tablet computer).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Again in 2011, Apple launched iCloud, its cloud computing service, which enabled the users to store their data from any Apple device on to Apple&#39;s cloud and then retrieve their data from the cloud using the same or any other Apple device. Apple once again upgraded Mac OS X to enable this.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1983">In 2015, Apple launched its Apple Watch device (smart watch) with WatchOS (described later). With this, Apple also released an upgraded version of Mac OS X with features to enable its personal computers and laptops to interoperate and share data with its watch device.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The salient features of Mac OS X include the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Intuitive user interface </b>that makes Apple&#39;s computer systems much easier to use than other systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Interoperable with iOS and WatchOS</b>, which enables users to share data and activities across various types of Apple devices. For example, while working on his/her laptop, if a user gets a phone call on his/her iPhone, he/she can take it from his/her laptop. Similarly, a user can copy text/image/audio/video files on any Apple device to any other apple device.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Supported with a large set of built-in applications </b>. Apple&#39;s AppStore has a large set of built-in applications for its users. Users by default get a powerful set of commonly used applications when they acquire an Apple device. Users can download other applications of their interest from the AppStore. Many of these applications provide interesting user experience  with  their  data.  For  example,  transforming  photos  into  video  clips; transforming  videos  into  movies;  creating  customized  messages  for  your friends/relatives/colleagues with a combination of text, image, audio and video; creating music with collected audio clips of your song and sounds from musical instruments; etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>iCloud facility </b>saves storage and allows a single copy of data to be shared across Apple&#39;s devices. With this facility, a user can store his/her data (photos, videos, music, documents, presentations, etc.) on Apple&#39;s cloud and access the same from any Apple device. For example, a user can create and upload documents from his/her laptop in iCloud, and then access it from his/her iPhone, whenever required. The user can even share his/her iCloud Drive link with his/her friends/relatives/colleagues to share his/her data stored in the iCloud with them.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Privacy and security features help users work in a trusted environment. </b>Designers of Mac OS built it from the ground up with privacy and security in mind. Mac OS protects personal information of users and their data with strong encryption and strict security policies that govern how the system handles various types of data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Flexibility to work with Windows OS </b>is another powerful feature of Mac OS. This feature enables users to run Windows OS on their Apple computers, whenever required. It</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">also enables users to transfer documents (files, photos, Excel sheets, PowerPoint presentations, etc.) created on a Windows OS platform to a Mac OS platform.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Use by differently abled users. </b>Mac OS also has several features to enable use of its computers by users with physical disabilities. VoiceOver, FaceTime, Text-to-Speech are a few such features.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part390.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part392.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
