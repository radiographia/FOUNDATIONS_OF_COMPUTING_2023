In a </span></a>symmetric cryptosystem, <span class="p">either both the encryption key </span>(K<span class="s35">e</span>) <span class="p">and decryption key </span>(K<span class="s35">d</span>) <span class="p">are the same or one is easily derivable from the other. Usually, a common key </span>(K) <span class="p">is used for both enciphering and deciphering. For security, it is important that users of a symmetric cryptosystem can easily alter the key and only authorized users know the key. Symmetric cryptosystems are also known as </span>shared-key <span class="p">or </span>private-key cryptosystems<span class="p">. They are useful in those situations where the subsystems performing both encryption and decryption of information are trusted subsystems. For example, a password-based user authentication system often uses this scheme for saving passwords in encrypted form. When a user declares a password, the operating system uses an encryption key to encrypt the password before storing it internally. At the time of authentication of a user (identified by his/her </span>user-ID<span class="p">), the operating system retrieves the encrypted password corresponding to the specified </span>user-ID<span class="p">, decrypts it using the same key, and compares it with the password supplied by the user.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">In an </span>asymmetric cryptosystem, <span class="p">on the other hand, the decryption key </span>(K<span class="s35">d</span>) <span class="p">is not equal to the encryption key </span>(K<span class="s35">e</span>). <span class="p">Furthermore, it is computationally impractical to derive </span>K<span class="s35">d </span><span class="p">from </span>K<span class="s35">e</span>. <span class="p">Hence, the system needs to keep only </span>K<span class="s35">d </span><span class="p">secret, and makes </span>K<span class="s35">e </span><span class="p">publicly known. Asymmetric cryptosystems are also known as </span>public-key cryptosystems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Public-key cryptosystems are computationally expensive. Hence, they are unsuitable for bulk data encryption. A typical use of a public-key cryptosystem is for establishing a secured communication channel (virtual connection) between two communicating entities <i>(A </i>and <i>B) </i>in a distributed system. Once the system establishes a secured communication channel between entities <i>A </i>and <i>B</i>, they can then exchange messages using a symmetric cryptosystem. Let us assume that <i>A </i>and <i>B </i>want to establish a connection between them for initiating message transfers using a symmetric cryptosystem whose key is <i>K. </i>Note that it is insecure to send key <i>K </i>over a normal communication channel for the purpose of sharing it with <i>A </i>and <i>B. </i>Therefore, the system first uses a public-key cryptosystem to establish a secured connection between <i>A </i>and <i>B </i>in the following manner:</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><span class="p">1. Entity </span>A <span class="p">posts encryption key </span>(K<span class="s35">e</span>) <span class="p">of a public-key cryptosystem on, say, an electronic bulletin board, so that it is obtainable by </span>B.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Entity <i>B </i>uses A&#39;s public key to encrypt key <i>K </i>and transmits it to <i>A.</i></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">3. Entity </span>A <span class="p">decrypts </span>B&#39;s <span class="p">message using decryption key </span>(K<span class="s35">d</span>) <span class="p">of the public-key cryptosystem. Only </span>A <span class="p">can decrypt this message because </span>K<span class="s35">d </span><span class="p">is available with </span>A <span class="p">only</span>.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">4. Now that </span>A <span class="p">also has key </span>K, <span class="p">both </span>A <span class="p">and </span>B <span class="p">can communicate safely with each other using the symmetric cryptosystem scheme. Any eavesdropper would only have public key </span>(K<span class="s35">e</span>), <span class="p">encrypted form of key </span>K, <span class="p">and encrypted form of the messages exchanged between </span>A <span class="p">and </span>B.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One pitfall here is that someone else could masquerade as <i>A </i>or <i>B. </i>The system can overcome this problem by using digital signatures (described later in this chapter).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The relative advantages and disadvantages of symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. A symmetric cryptosystem requires that only trusted subsystems should perform both encryption and decryption of information. An asymmetric cryptosystem does not require this. Therefore, general security policies need asymmetric cryptosystems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. When a communication system uses a symmetric cryptosystem for ensuring security of exchanged messages between two communicating entities, it requires a secure channel by which the sender can inform the receiver of the key, which they will be using to encrypt/decrypt messages. However, the system may transmit the encrypted messages through an insecure channel. On the other hand, in an asymmetric cryptosystem, the system can transmit both the public-key and the messages through an insecure channel. Therefore, there is no need for a special secure channel for key transmission. Hence, asymmetric cryptosystems are more secure than symmetric cryptosystems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Normally, asymmetric cryptosystems are computationally much more expensive than symmetric cryptosystems. Hence, asymmetric cryptosystems are inefficient for bulk data encryption.  In  practice,  therefore,  data  communication  systems  use  asymmetric cryptosystems for initialization/control functions only, and symmetric cryptosystems for actual data transfer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Data Encryption Standard (DES) is the best known and most widely used symmetric cryptosystem, whereas Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) is the first published and practically the most satisfactory asymmetric cryptosystem.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part541.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part543.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
