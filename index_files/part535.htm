For external security, the commonly used methods include maintaining adequate backup copies of stored information at places far away from the original information, using security guards to allow entry of only authorized persons into a computer center, allowing access to sensitive information to only trusted employees/users, and so on.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Internal security, <span class="p">on the other hand, deals mainly with the following three aspects:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>User authentication. </b>Once a user gets physical access to a computer system, the system must check the user&#39;s identification before allowing the user to use its resources.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Access control. </b>A computer system contains many resources and several types of information. Obviously, not all resources and information are meant for all users. Therefore, even when a user passes the authentication phase and the system allows the user to use its resources; the system needs a mechanism to prohibit the user from accessing such resources/information, for which he/she is not having access authorization. In fact, a secure system requires that at any time a subject (person or program) should have access to only those resources that it needs currently to complete its task. This requirement is known as <i>need-to-know principle </i>or <i>principle of least privilege</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Communication security. </b>In a distributed system, attackers often use communication channels (that connect multiple computers and are vulnerable to attacks) to breach the system&#39;s security by observing, modifying, or disrupting the communications. Wireless networks are even more vulnerable to monitoring by intruders because anyone with a scanner can pluck the radio signals out of the air, and it is difficult to detect such intrusion. Communication security mechanisms safeguard against unauthorized tampering of information from communication channels. Two other aspects of communication security are authenticity of communicating entities and integrity of messages. That is, the sender of a message wants confirmation that the intended receiver received the message, and the receiver of a message wants confirmation that the message is from a genuine sender. Obviously, both the sender and receiver also want to ensure that no one changed the contents of the message while it was in transfer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part534.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part536.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
