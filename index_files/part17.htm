Transistors soon proved to be a better electronic switching device than vacuum tubes.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Second-generation computers were manufactured using transistors. They were more powerful, more reliable, less expensive, smaller, and cooler to operate than the first-generation computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The second generation also experienced a change in storage technology. Memory of second- generation computers was composed of magnetic cores. Magnetic cores are small rings made of ferrite that can be magnetized in either clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. Large random access memory (having storage capacity of few tens of kilobytes) had several magnetic cores strung on a mesh of wires.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In 1957, researchers introduced magnetic tape as a faster and more convenient secondary storage medium. Later magnetic disk storage was also developed, and magnetic disk and magnetic tape were the main secondary storage media used in second-generation computers. Users still used punched cards widely for preparing and feeding programs and data to a computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On software front, high-level programming languages (like FORTRAN, COBOL, ALGOL, and SNOBOL) and batch  operating system emerged  during second generation.  High-level programming languages made second-generation computers easier to program and use than first- generation computers. Introduction of batch operating system helped in reducing human intervention while processing multiple jobs resulting in faster processing, enhanced throughput, and easier operation of second-generation computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark656">In addition to scientific computations, business and industry users used second-generation computers increasingly for commercial data processing applications like payroll, inventory control, marketing, and production planning.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ease of use of second-generation computers gave birth to a new profession of programmers and systems analysts in computing that is more oriented towards usage rather than design of computers. This triggered introduction of computer science related courses in several colleges and universities.</p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="165" alt="image" src="Image_058.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark657">Figure 1.4. </a><span class="s21">Electronics devices used for manufacturing computers of different generations.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part16.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part18.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
