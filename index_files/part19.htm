This progress soon led to the era of <i>large-scale integration </i>(<i>LSI</i>) when it was possible to integrate over 30,000 electronic components on a single chip, followed by <i>very-large-scale integration </i>(<i>VLSI</i>) when it was possible to integrate about one million electronic components on a single chip. This progress led to a dramatic development - creation of a microprocessor. A <i>microprocessor </i>contains all circuits needed to perform arithmetic logic and control functions, the core activities of all computers, on a single chip. Hence, it became possible to build a complete computer with a microprocessor, a few additional primary storage chips, and other support circuitry. It started a new social revolution - <i>personal computer </i>( <i>PC</i>) revolution. Overnight computers became incredibly compact. They became inexpensive to make, and it became possible for many to own a computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">By 1978, Apple II from Apple Computer Inc. and the TRS-80 model from the Radio Shack Division of Tandy Corporation were dominant personal computers. By 1980, IBM realized that the personal computer market was too promising to ignore and came out with its own PC in 1981, popularly known as IBM PC. Several other manufacturers used IBM&#39;s specification and designed their own PCs, popularly known as IBM compatible PCs or clones. The IBM PC and its clones became a popular standard for the PC industry during the fourth generation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">During fourth generation, semiconductor memories replaced magnetic core memories resulting in large random access memories with fast access time. Hard disks became cheaper, smaller, and larger in capacity. In addition to magnetic tapes, floppy disks became popular as a portable medium for porting programs and data from one computer to another.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Significant advancements also took place during fourth generation in the area of large-scale computer systems. In addition to improved processing and storage capabilities of mainframe systems, the fourth-generation saw the advent of supercomputers based on parallel vector processing and symmetric multiprocessing technologies. A supercomputer based on parallel vector processing technology contains a small number of custom-designed vector processors which are connected to a number of high-speed data access shared memory modules through a custom-designed, high-bandwidth crossbar switch network. On the other hand, a supercomputer based on symmetric multiprocessing technology uses commodity microprocessors connected to a shared memory through a high-speed bus or a crossbar switch network. Primary builders of supercomputers of the former category included Cray Research and ETA Systems, whereas of the latter category included IBM, Silicon Graphics, and Digital Equipment Corporation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">High-speed computer networking also developed during fourth-generation. This enabled interconnection of multiple computers for communication and sharing of data among them. Local area networks (LANs) became popular for connecting computers within an organization or within a campus. Similarly, wide area networks (WANs) became popular for connecting computers located at larger distances. This gave rise to network of computers and distributed systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On software front, several new developments emerged to match the new technologies of fourth generation. For example, vendors developed several new operating systems for PCs. Notable ones among these were MS-DOS, MS-Windows, and Apple&#39;s propriety Mac OS. Since PCs were for individuals who were not computer professionals, companies developed graphical user interfaces for making computers user friendly (easier to use). A <i>graphical user interface </i>(<i>GUI</i>)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">provides icons (pictures) and menus (list of choices) that users can select with a mouse. PC manufacturers and application software developers developed several new PC-based applications to make PCs a powerful tool. Notable among these were powerful word processing packages that allowed easy development of documents, spreadsheet package that allowed easy manipulation and analysis of data organized in columns and rows, and graphics packages that allowed easy drawing of pictures and diagrams. Another useful concept that became popular during fourth- generation was multiple windows on a single terminal screen, which allowed users to see the status of several applications simultaneously in separate windows on the same terminal screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the area of software for large-scale computers, key technologies that became popular included multiprocessing  operating  systems  and  concurrent  programming  languages.  With multiprocessing operating systems, a mainframe system could use multiple processors (a main processor and several subordinate processors) in such a manner that the subordinate processors could manage the user terminals and peripheral devices, allowing the main processor to concentrate  on  processing  the  main  program,  improving  the  overall  performance. Supercomputers also used multiprocessing operating system to extract the best performance from the large number of processors used in these systems. Concurrent programming languages further helped in using the multiprocessing capabilities of these systems by allowing programmers to write their applications in such a way that different processors could execute parts of the application in parallel. The most ambitious language of this type was ADA.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">During fourth-generation, the UNIX operating system also became popular for use on large-scale systems. Additionally, due to proliferation of computer networks, several new features were included in existing operating systems to allow multiple computers on the same network to communicate with each other and share resources.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark661">Some other software technologies that became popular during fourth-generation are C programming language, object-oriented software design, and object-oriented programming. C language combines features of high-level programming languages with efficiency of an assembly language. The primary objectives of </a><i>object-oriented software design </i>are to make programs generalized and to build software systems by combining reusable pieces of program codes called objects. To facilitate object-oriented software design, several object-oriented programming languages were introduced, out of which, C++ emerged as the most popular one.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part18.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part20.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
