It is a serial bus, which supports four speeds - a super-speed mode of 5 Gbits/sec, a high-speed mode of 480 Mbits/sec, a full-speed mode of 12 Mbits/sec, and a low-speed mode of 1.5 Mbits/sec. USB version 3.0 supports super-speed mode, version 2.0 supports high-speed mode, while the earlier version 1.1 supported full-speed and low-speed modes. The latest USB version 4.0 promises to support 40 Gbits/sec.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">USB is host controlled in the sense that there can be only one host per bus. USB standard aims at and is limited to single point-to-point connections such as a mobile phone and personal organizer, and not multiple hub, multiple device desktop configurations. The USB host is responsible for undertaking all transactions and scheduling bandwidth.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">USB uses a tiered star topology, similar to that of 10BaseT Ethernet. This imposes the use of a hub somewhere for connecting devices to USB. Many devices have USB hubs integrated into them. For example, keyboard and monitor contain a hub connected to a computer&#39;s USB port. We can connect other I/O devices to the keyboard or monitor using the hub they have. For example, we often plug a mouse into the back of a keyboard, and a digital camera into the front/back/side of a monitor. USB&#39;s tiered star topology, rather than daisy chaining devices together, has the following benefits:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. We can monitor power to each device and even switch off a device, if an over current condition occurs without disrupting other USB devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. It can support all four types (super-speed, high-speed, full-speed, and low-speed) of devices, with the hub filtering out transactions of different speed, so that low-speed devices do not receive high speed transactions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At any given time, we can connect up to 127 devices to a single USB. If we need to connect more devices, we can add another port/host. While earlier USB hosts had two ports, the latest ones support 4 and 5 port host cards with an internal port for hard disks. The early hosts had one USB controller, and thus, both ports shared the same available USB bandwidth. As bandwidth requirements grew, manufacturers are now making multi-port cards with two or more controllers, allowing individual channels for each port.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">USB supports plug-and-play facility with dynamically loadable and unloadable drivers. When a user plugs in a device into the bus, the host detects this addition, interrogates the newly inserted device, and loads the appropriate driver. Once the user finishes using the device, he/she pulls the cable out and the host detects its absence and automatically unloads the driver. A pen drive plugs into a USB port of a computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another important feature of USB is its support for bus-powered devices - devices that obtain its power from the bus and require no batteries, or external plugs, or additional cables. Additionally,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a USB device enters suspend mode automatically when there is no activity on the bus for more than 3.0 ms. It then has a further 7.0 ms to shutdown the device and draw no more than the designated suspend power. Hence, it draws only the rated suspend power from the bus 10.0 ms (3 ms + 7 ms) after bus activity stops. This feature makes USB devices power-efficient.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part204.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part206.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
