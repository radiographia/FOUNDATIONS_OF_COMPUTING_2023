The graph represents a state by a circle, and transitions between states by directed lines connecting the circles.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part90.htm#bookmark904" class="s23">Since both state table and state diagram are two different forms of representing a sequential circuit, we can derive the state diagram of a sequential circuit from its state table. </a><a href="part90.htm#bookmark904" class="s3">Figure </a>3.31<a href="part90.htm#bookmark904" class="s23">(c) shows the state diagram of the sequential circuit of </a><a href="part90.htm#bookmark904" class="s3">Figure </a>3.31<a href="part90.htm#bookmark904" class="s23">(a), whose state table is shown in </a><a href="part90.htm#bookmark904" class="s3">Figure </a>3.31<span class="p">(b). In the state diagram, each circle denotes a state of the flip-flops and has a binary number inside it to identify the state. Each directed line has a label of the form “input/output” in binary. For example, the directed line labeled 1/0 from state 00 to 01 indicates that when the sequential circuit is in the present state 00 and the input is 1, the output is 0, and the circuit goes to the next state 01 on a clock transition. We can verify this transition of the circuit from the entries in the 2</span><span class="s22">nd </span><span class="p">row of the state table. Similarly, we can transform each row of the state table into a directed line of the state graph to obtain the complete state graph of the sequential circuit. A directed line connecting a circle with itself indicates that no change of state occurs.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Notice from the above that state table of a sequential circuit is easier to derive from its logic diagram, and we can easily derive its state diagram from the state table.

For example, it can be seen from the state diagram of </a><a href="part90.htm#bookmark904" class="s3">Figure </a>3.31<span class="p">(c) that when the sequential circuit is in the present state 11, then</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a. if input is 0, next state will be 00 and output will be 1; and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">b. if input is 1, next state will be 10 and output will be 0.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part90.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part92.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
