Graphics is an important component of multimedia applications because a picture is a powerful way to illustrate information. For example, in a multimedia application for educating children, displaying the photograph of a horse along with its textual description makes the illustration more effective. Without the photograph, it will be difficult to explain (using text only) how a horse looks like. Similarly, displaying the photo of an</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">employee along with his/her name, address, sex, age, etc. from a company&#39;s database of employees makes the employee&#39;s information more effective.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Graphics Types</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pictures used in computer graphics are broadly of two types:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2391">1. </a><b>Line drawings. </b>Line drawings are illustrations in the form of 2D and 3D pictures created from the mathematical representation of simple objects like lines, circles, arcs, etc. A user creates complex objects by using simple object types. For example, a designer can draw a picture of a chair by using lines and arcs. A system can also transform and present numerical results obtained from computations into graphics forms, like bar graphs or pie charts, by using simple objects.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The area of computer graphics that deals with this type of pictures is known as <i>generative graphics</i>. Generative graphics is extensively used for creating illustrative diagrams. For example, this book uses this technique for most of its figures (illustrative diagrams).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Two important applications of generative graphics are CAD (Computer Aided Design) and CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing). Designers often use CAD packages to design models of aircraft, ship, building, etc. They also use CAD packages to design layout of printed circuit boards, chemical plant pipelines, etc. Based on these drawings, CAM packages automatically generate and use manufacturing information such as parts list, subassembly list, etc. The greatest advantage of using CAD and CAM packages for such applications is that a designer can quickly check design ideas and conceptualize the ideas graphically in an interactive manner. Moreover, the designer can quickly carry out design changes, creating accurate assembly drawings of associated parts, and subassembly lists immediately.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Images. </b><a href="part512.htm#bookmark2392" class="s23">Images are pictures and photographs, which are composed of collection of pixels (short form of “picture element”, a unit of measurement across a computer screen). A computer stores pixels of an image as a two-dimensional matrix (</a><a href="part512.htm#bookmark2392" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">14.1</span>). This two- dimensional (or spatial) representation is called image resolution. Since storage representation of an image is its direct translation, pixel-by-pixel, no concept of a line, arc, or circle exists.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part512.htm#bookmark2392" class="s23">Each pixel is composed of three components: red (R), green (G), and blue (B) (see </a><a href="part512.htm#bookmark2392" class="s3">Figure</a><a href="part512.htm#bookmark2392" class="s24"> </a><a href="part512.htm#bookmark2392" class="s3">14.1</a><a href="part512.htm#bookmark2392" class="s23">). On a display screen, each component of a pixel corresponds to a phosphor. </a>A phosphor glows when excited by an electron gun. Various combinations of different RGB intensities produce different colors. Number of bits used to represent a pixel is called color depth, which decides the actual number of colors available to represent a pixel. Color depth in turn is determined by the size of the video buffer in display circuitry. For example, a screen with 640 x 480 resolution and with 24-b color (i.e., 8 bits each for R, G, and B components) displays 640 pixels horizontally and 480 vertically, and can represent each pixel by selecting from more than 2<span class="s22">24 </span>(≈ 16.7 million) different colors. Resolution and color depth determine the presentation quality and size of image storage. More pixels and more colors produce better quality and larger volume. For example, a 640 x 480 image with 24-b color requires 640 x 480 x 24b = 7.4 Mb of storage. Computer applications use image compression techniques (discussed later in this chapter) to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">compress images to reduce their size before storing or transmitting them. This often results in substantial saving of storage space and communication bandwidth.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The area of computer graphics that deals with this type of pictures is known as <i>cognitive graphics</i>. Computer applications, which deal with the recognition and classification of pictures make extensive use of cognitive graphics along with image processing techniques (like image compression and decompression, cleaning of noisy or blurred images, image editing, etc.). For example, criminal-investigation application based on fingerprint identification uses an image database containing images of peoples&#39; fingerprints. Another similar application is classification of images of ECG patterns, X-rays of different parts of body, etc. to perform medical diagnosis of patients by using computers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="446" height="102" alt="image" src="Image_760.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2392">Figure 14.1. </a><span class="s21">An image composition.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hardware Requirements for Graphics</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Normally, modern computers use the following hardware devices for graphics processing capability:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2393">1. A locating device (such as a mouse, joystick, or stylus) with a video display terminal and drawing software to draw pictures on computer screen from scratch for generative graphics applications.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. A flatbed or rectangular coordinate digitizer to enable generative graphics applications to input existing line drawings (such as a map) into a computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Scanners (optical scanners, image-scan digitizers, etc.) to enable cognitive graphics applications to capture photographs and drawings as digital images.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Digital camera or frame-capture hardware (such as a video-capture board interfaced to some standard video source like video camera or video recorder) to capture digital images.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Computer screens with graphics display capability to display graphics. Standard VGA (Video Graphics Array) graphics can display 640 pixels across and 480 pixels down (referred to as having a resolution of 640 x 480) on a monitor with 16 colors (or gray scales, if the monitor is a monochrome monitor). Although there are higher resolutions available (for example, Super VGA has a resolution of 800 x 600), Standard VGA can display good images and comes with many modern computers. Standard VGA requires a VGA board and a monitor capable of displaying VGA graphics. A Standard VGA board comes with 256K of memory attached to it. This limits 640 x 480 VGA displays to 16 colors. Both the resolution and the number of colors of display increases by increasing the board&#39;s memory. For example, resolution of 640 x 480 with 256 colors, and resolutions of 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768 with 256 colors are possible by increasing this memory to 512K and 1 MB, respectively. These are called <i>extended graphics</i>. Higher resolutions with more</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">colors make image displays noticeably better. However, the computer system must have a monitor capable of displaying such high-resolution images.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6. Laser printers to output graphics in hard copy form.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7. Plotters to output graphics in hard copy form.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Software Requirements for Graphics</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following graphics-processing capabilities are desirable in a multimedia computer system for better presentation and use of graphics information:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Drawing and painting software. </b>This software enables users to create graphics from scratch by using a mouse and various simple objects such as lines, circles, and polygons, with various supporting colors. It also enables a user to modify and enhance graphic images, which the user produced using a scanner or screen-capture software. These features make this software useful for creating graphics in multimedia applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Screens-capture software. </b>This software enables users to take a snapshot of a computer screen display and capture it as a graphic image. It allows users to save graphic images in a variety of graphic formats, and to convert a graphic image from one storage format to another when a multimedia application accepts image data in a particular format only.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Clip art. </b>Clip art is a library of graphic images of common objects (such as personal computer, printer, airplane, telephone, flower, building, etc.), which users frequently need to incorporate in their multimedia applications. A user can directly import any image from the library, and use it in a multimedia application. This saves lot of time and effort that the user might require otherwise to create or search a similar image object. This is also helpful, if a user does not have a scanner or some other means of inputting graphics into computer. A clip art library often provides facilities to add a new image object or delete an existing image object from the library.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Graphics importing. </b>A graphics importing software enables a user to import graphic images in some standard formats and to use it in a multimedia application. Common standard graphic formats are .BMP, .GIF, and .PCX.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2394">5. </a><b>Software support for high resolution. </b>If a multimedia application needs to display high quality images, it is important to have not only the necessary hardware, but also software support for high-resolution graphics. Some software cannot display a resolution greater than 640 x 480 pixels. Others cannot display more than 16 colors. Most software, however, support Standard VGA graphic images. Hence, extended graphics hardware feature must also have the right software for displaying higher resolution graphics with 256 colors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part511.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part513.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
