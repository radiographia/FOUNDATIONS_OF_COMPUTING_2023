For example, when cost is more important than performance, a computer system architect might decide not to use special electronic circuits (hardware) to multiply two numbers, but instead write instructions (software) to cause the machine to accomplish the same function by repeated use of circuits designed already to perform addition. This software (known as firmware) is stored in a read-only memory (ROM) chip of the computer, and is executed (used) whenever the computer has to multiply two numbers. Hence, firmware is software substituted for hardware and stored in read- only memory.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="398" height="235" alt="image" src="Image_439.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 225pt;text-indent: -203pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1407">Figure 7.1. </a><span class="s21">Relationship among hardware, system software, application software, and users of a computer system.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Initially, vendors supplied only system software in the form of firmware. However, many vendors now supply even application programs as firmware. Vendors also program dedicated applications in this fashion and make them available as firmware. Because of rapid improvement in memory technology, firmware is frequently a cost-effective alternative to wired electronic circuits, and its use in computer design has been increasing gradually. In fact, increased use of firmware has today made it possible to produce smart machines of all types. These machines have microprocessor chips with embedded software.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part213.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part215.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
