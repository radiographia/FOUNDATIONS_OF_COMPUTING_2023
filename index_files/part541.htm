It must be easy to use and its encryption and decryption algorithms should be efficient for computer application.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. There are two methods to achieve security. In the first method, the designer/owner of a cryptosystem keeps the encryption algorithm secret, and the algorithm is complex and difficult to guess. In the second method, the designer/owner of a cryptosystem makes the encryption algorithm public, but keeps the keys secret, and a key is long enough to make it practically impossible to guess. The second method is preferred for practically useful systems. That is, security of a cryptosystem should depend only on secrecy of its keys and not on secrecy of its encryption algorithm.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. The system must be computationally (practically) secure. That is, determination of <i>Kd </i>must be computationally infeasible for an attacker (also called a cryptanalyst). Strength of a cryptosystem is measured by the level of difficulty (usually measured either by the time or number of elementary operations) of determining <i>K</i><span class="s35">d</span>. Depending on the amount of information available to an intruder, in a cryptosystem, attacks are mainly of three types - ciphertext only, known plaintext, and chosen plaintext.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In <i>ciphertext-only </i>attack, an intruder is able to intercept ciphertext and tries to derive <i>K</i><span class="s35">d </span>from the ciphertext. A system that cannot resist a ciphertext-only attack is totally insecure and useless.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In <i>known-plaintext </i>attack, an intruder has considerable amount of both ciphertext and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">corresponding plaintext and tries to derive <i>K</i><span class="s35">d </span>from them. A system that can resist a known-plaintext attack is considered secure.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In <i>chosen-plaintext </i>attack, an intruder has access to ciphertext for any plaintext of his/her choice. The intruder tries to derive <i>K</i><span class="s35">d </span>by examining several ciphertexts for carefully thought plaintexts of his/her choice. It is most appropriate nowadays to evaluate cryptosystems by their ability to withstand chosen-plaintext attacks.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another way by which evaluators evaluate a cryptosystem is by test of time. If users of a cryptosystem have not reported any known successful attacks since its publication, and the system has been in use for a significant amount of time (measured in years), the cryptosystem is considered to probably provide pretty good security.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part540.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part542.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
