A separate module of operating system software performs each of these functions:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Process management. </b>A <i>process </i>is a program in execution. During execution, a process needs certain resources such as CPU time, memory space, files, and I/O devices. At any time, an active computer system normally consists of a collection of processes. Process management module takes care of creation and deletion of processes, scheduling of system resources to different processes requesting them, and providing mechanisms for synchronization and communication among processes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Memory management. </b>To execute a program, it must be loaded in main memory (at least partially), together with the data it accesses. To improve CPU utilization and to provide better response time to its users, a computer system normally keeps several programs in main memory. Memory management module takes care of allocation and de-allocation of memory space to programs in need of this resource.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>File management. </b>All computer systems store, retrieve, and share information. Normally, a computer stores such information in units called <i>files</i>. Processes read information from files and create new files for storing newly generated information. A process makes the information in a file persistent by storing the file on a secondary storage media such as a magnetic disk. To share information, an application can create a file and share it later with different applications. File management module takes care of file-related activities such as organization, storage, retrieval, naming, sharing, and protection of files. It allows programs to use a set of operations that characterize the file abstraction and free the programmers from concerns about the details of space allocation and layout of the secondary storage device.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Device management. </b>A computer system consists of several I/O devices such as terminal, printer, disk, and tape. The device management module of an operating system controls all I/O devices. It keeps track of I/O requests from processes, issues commands to I/O devices, and ensures correct data transmission to/from an I/O device. It also provides a simple and easy to use interface between the devices and rest of the system. Often, this interface is device independent, that is, the interface is same for all types of I/O devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1866">5. </a><b>Security. </b>Users can trust a computer system and rely on it only if its various resources and information stored in it are protected against destruction and unauthorized access. Security module protects the resources and information of a computer system against destruction and unauthorized access. It also ensures that when the system executes several disjoint processes simultaneously, one process does not interfere with others or with the operating system itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Command interpretation. </b>For using various system resources, a user communicates with the operating system via a set of commands provided by it. The operating system also provides a simple language, known as command language (CL) or job control language (JCL); using which a user can put several commands together from the command set to describe the resource requirements of a job. Command interpretation module interprets user commands, and directs system resources to process the commands. With this mode of interaction with a system, users need not be concerned about the hardware details of the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An operating system also performs few other functions such as accounting of usage of system resources by the users (or processes), maintenance of log of system usage by the users, and maintenance of internal time clock.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part345.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part347.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
