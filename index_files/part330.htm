There might be many reasons for the success of a language, but one obvious reason is its characteristics. Several characteristics believed to be important for a good programming language are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Simplicity</b><i><b>. </b></i>A good programming language must be simple and easy to learn and use. It should provide a clear, simple, and unified set of concepts to a programmer that he/she can grasp easily. The overall simplicity of a programming language affects the readability of the programs written in that language, and programs that are easier to read and understand are easier to maintain. It is also easy to develop and implement a compiler or an interpreter for a simple programming language. However, for achieving simplicity, designers should not sacrifice the power needed for the language. For example, many programmers like BASIC because of its simplicity.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Naturalness</b><i><b>. </b></i>A good language for an application domain should be natural for programming applications of that domain. That is, it should provide appropriate operators, data structures, control structures, and a natural syntax to facilitate programmers to code their problems easily and efficiently. FORTRAN and COBOL are good examples of languages possessing high degree of naturalness in scientific and business application domains, respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Abstraction. </b>Abstraction means the ability to define and then use complicated structures or operations in ways that allows programmers to ignore many of the details. The degree of abstraction allowed by a programming language affects its ease of programming. For</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">example, object-oriented languages support high degree of abstraction. Hence, writing programs in object-oriented languages is much easier. Object-oriented languages also support reusability of program segments due to this feature.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Efficiency. </b>A program written in a good programming language enables a computer system to translate it into machine code efficiently, execute it efficiently, and manage it with less memory space. That is, a good programming language is supported with a good language translator (a compiler or an interpreter) that gives due consideration to space and time efficiency.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Structured programming support. </b>A good programming language should have necessary features to allow programmers to write their programs based on the concepts of structured programming. This property affects the ease with which a programmer can write, test, and maintain his/her programs. Moreover, it forces the programmer to look at a problem in a logical way so that he/she creates fewer errors while writing a program for the problem.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Compactness. </b>In a good programming language, programmers should be able to express the intended operations concisely without losing readability. Programmers do not like a verbose language because they need to write too much. Many programmers dislike COBOL because it is verbose in nature (lacks compactness).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Locality. </b>A good programming language should be such that while writing a program, a programmer need not jump around visually as the text of the program is prepared. This allows the programmer to concentrate on the part of the program around the statement he/she is currently working with. COBOL and to some extent C and Pascal lack locality because data definitions are separated from processing statements, perhaps by many pages of code, or have to appear before any processing statement in the function/procedure.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. <b>Extensibility. </b>A good programming language should also allow extension through simple, natural, and elegant mechanisms. Almost all languages provide subprogram definition mechanisms for this purpose, but some languages are weak in this aspect.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. <b>Suitability to its environment. </b>In addition to being suitable to its application domain, a good programming language must also be suitable to its operating environment. For example, a language for real-time applications must be interactive in nature. On the other hand, a language for data processing applications like payroll, stores accounting, etc., may operate in batch mode.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part329.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part331.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
