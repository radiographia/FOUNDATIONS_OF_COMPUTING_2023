It takes one statement of the high-level language program, translates it into machine language instructions, and executes the resulting machine language instructions immediately, before taking up the next statement. Hence, the translation and execution processes alternate for each statement encountered in the high-level language program. This differs from a compiler that merely translates the entire source program into an object program, and is not involved in its execution. The input to an interpreter is a source program, but unlike a compiler, its output is the result of program execution, instead of an object program (see </a><a href="part318.htm#bookmark1744" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">9.12</span><span class="p">).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="551" height="61" alt="image" src="Image_578.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1744">Figure 9.12. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating the role of an interpreter.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After compilation of a source program, a user saves the resulting object program for future use, and uses it whenever he/she has to execute the program. Hence, repeated compilation (translation of the source code) is not necessary for repeated execution of a program. However, in case of an interpreter, since a user cannot save the object program for future use, repeated interpretation (translation plus execution) of a program is necessary for its repeated execution. Since an interpreter translates and executes a high-level language program statement-by-statement, it reinterprets (translates and executes) a program statement every time it encounters that statement during program execution. For example, during execution of a program, it reinterprets the instructions in a loop as many times as the process executes the loop.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As compared to compilers, interpreters are easier to write because they are less complex programs than compilers. They also require less memory space for execution than compilers require.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The main advantage of interpreters over compilers is that an interpreter flags a syntax error in a program statement to a programmer as soon as it interprets the program statement. This allows the programmer to make corrections during interactive program development. Therefore, interpreters make it easier and faster to correct programs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The main disadvantage of interpreters over compilers is that they are slower than compilers when running a finished program. This is because an interpreter translates each statement from the source program every time it executes it. A compiler translates each statement only once and saves it in the object program. We can execute the saved object program many times whenever needed, and no translation of any statement is required during the execution of the program. As the interpreter does not produce an object code for a program, it must perform the translation process each time it executes the program.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To combine the advantages of both interpreters and compilers, sometimes, the program development environment of a computer system provides both a compiler and an interpreter for a high-level language. In such systems, a programmer first uses the interpreter to develop and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">debug his/her program. Then, after reaching a bug-free state, he/she compiles the program to obtain its object code and uses the object code for routine processing subsequently.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We also refer to assemblers, compilers, and interpreters as <i>language processors </i>since they process language instructions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part317.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part319.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
