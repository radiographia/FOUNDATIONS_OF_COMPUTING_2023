Although, a system may use any of the three basic approaches to authentication for user login authentication, proof by knowledge is the most widely used method. In particular, most systems use direct-demonstration method based on passwords.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In password-based authentication scheme, a system maintains a table of authorized users&#39; login names and their corresponding passwords. When a user wants to log in, the system asks the user to type his/her login name and password. If the user-supplied password matches the password stored in the system against the user&#39;s login name, the system concludes that the user is legitimate and permits his/her login, otherwise denies login.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To be practically useful, a password-based authentication system must have mechanisms for:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Keeping passwords secret;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Making passwords difficult to guess;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Limiting damages done by a compromised password;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. Identifying and discouraging unauthorized user logins; and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5. Single sign-on for using all resources in the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some commonly used mechanisms for dealing with these issues are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Keeping Passwords Secret</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A user is responsible for keeping his/her password secret outside a computer system (external</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2550">world). When a user types a password, the system does not display it on its terminal to prevent it from prying eyes near the terminal. The main concern in keeping passwords secret is to prevent an intruder from obtaining somebody&#39;s password by accessing the system&#39;s password table. Of course, a system keeps its password table protected and permits only the authentication program to access it. However, password table may be exposed by accident, or the system may permit the system administrator to access it. Therefore, instead of storing login names and passwords in plaintext form, the system encrypts them and stores them in ciphertext form in password table. In this case, when a user supplies a login name and password at login time, the system encrypts them first and then uses the results for table lookup. The main requirement of this scheme is that even if an intruder knows the encryption function and is able to access the password table, it should be impossible for him/her/it to find the original password. Hence, the scheme needs a noninvertible encryption function because there is no need to decrypt a ciphertext. This is an example of use of </a><i>one-way cipher. </i>In cryptography, we use the function</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">C = <i>E (P, K)</i></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">where <i>K </i>is a key, <i>P </i>is a plaintext, and <i>C </i>is the resulting ciphertext. A one-way cipher can be implemented by letting the plaintext <i>P </i>serve as the key to <i>E </i>such that</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">C = <i>E (P, P)</i></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a one-way cipher, it is difficult for an intruder to invert the encryption function <i>(E) </i>even if he/she/it knows the key. Furthermore, if an intruder does not know the key (as in the case of password security scheme, which uses a password itself as the key), inversion becomes much more difficult because the intruder cannot know, which functions (and how many times of them) the one-way cipher uses.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To keep passwords secret in a distributed system, the system should never send passwords across the network in plaintext form. Moreover, the system should store passwords on only well protected, trusted servers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Making Passwords Difficult to Guess</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Use of mechanisms to keep passwords secret does not make passwords free from vulnerability. It only makes it difficult for intruders to obtain passwords. An intruder can still use trial-and-error method to obtain passwords. In fact, break-ins in password-based systems usually consist of guessing a user name and password combination. How successful an intruder can be in guessing passwords is obvious from a study conducted on UNIX systems by Morris and Thompson several years ago. They compiled a list of likely passwords that contained the first and last names of persons, names of cities and streets, words from a small dictionary spelled correctly and backward, short strings of random characters, and license plate numbers. They encrypted these passwords using a known password encryption algorithm to obtain a list of encrypted guessed passwords. They then prepared another list of encrypted passwords by using entries in password tables of various UNIX systems. Finally, they compared the entries in the two lists for matching entries. Surprisingly, they found that over 86% of actual passwords had a match in the list of guessed passwords.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A test of only a limited set of potential strings tends to reveal most passwords because normally people choose relatively short and simple passwords that they can easily remember. Some commonly used techniques to make passwords difficult to guess are:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Longer passwords. </b>A password&#39;s length (number of characters in it) determines the ease with which an intruder can guess it by exhaustive enumeration. For example, a three-digit password provides 1000 variations, whereas a four-digit password provides 10,000 variations. Longer passwords are less susceptible to enumeration because the work involved in enumerating all possible passwords increases by increasing the length of a password. A system normally uses a password entry program to enforce/encourage users to use longer passwords. A password entry program asks a user to enter a longer password, if he/she enters a short one.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2551">2. </a><b>Salting password table. </b>Another technique to make passwords difficult to guess is to lengthen them artificially by associating an <i>n-bit </i>random number with each password when a user first enters it. Salting algorithm changes the random number associated with a password, when a user changes the password. Instead of storing only the encrypted password in password table, the system first concatenates the password and the random number and then encrypts them together. The system stores this encrypted result in password table. In this scheme, the password table has an additional field that contains the random number in its unencrypted form. At login time, the system concatenates this random number with the entered password, encrypts them together, and then compares it with the stored encrypted value. Guessing of a password becomes difficult because if an intruder guesses <i>Tokyo </i>to be the password of a user, it is no longer enough to just encrypt <i>Tokyo </i>and compare the encrypted result with the value stored in password table. Rather, for each guess made, the intruder has to tryout <i>2</i><span class="s31">n </span>strings, such as <i>Tokyo0000, Tokyo0001, Tokyo0002, </i>and so forth, for <i>n </i>= 4. This increases encryption and comparison time for each guess made. UNIX uses this method with <i>n </i>= 12.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>System assistance in password selection. </b>A password can be either system generated or user selected. User-selected passwords are often easy to guess. Often, computer systems use mechanisms to assist users in using passwords that are difficult to guess. In one mechanism, the system stores a list of easy-to-guess passwords and first compares a user- selected password with the entries in the list. If it finds a match, it refuses to accept the selected password and asks the user to select another password informing him/her that the selected password is easy to guess. In another mechanism, the system uses a password generator program that generates random, easy-to-remember, meaningless words, such as <i>mounce, montee, dablooz</i>. A user selects a password suggested by the system and uses it with his/her own choice of a mixture of upper-and lower-case letters of that word, such as <i>dAbLOoZ.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Limiting Damages Done by a Compromised Password</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A user should change his/her password frequently to reduce the damage that an intruder can do after being successful in obtaining the user&#39;s current password. This is because the intruder will have to obtain the user&#39;s new password after the user changes his/her current password. The extreme form of this approach is use of <i>one-time passwords. </i>The three commonly used methods to implement one-time passwords are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Password book. </b>In this method, a user gets a password book containing a list of passwords. For each login, the user uses the next password in the list. Obviously, the user must keep the password book in a secure place.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Specifying next login password. </b>In this method, every time a user logs out, the system asks him/her to specify a new password for next login and replaces the old password with the new one. The user either remembers the new password or notes it down somewhere for use at the time of next login.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Synchronized password generator. </b>This method relies on the use of a special equipment such as smart cards or synchronized password generators. For example, a synchronized password generator device generates a pseudorandom alphanumeric word or number that changes every minute or so and is time synchronized to a database stored in the computer. To log in, a user types in the word or number displayed on the card at the time of login. It results in a one-time password that is good only at that point in time and for only one login.  One  such  device  is  the  SecureID  from  Security  Dynamics  (Cambridge, Massachusetts). This method has not been successful thus far, primarily due to the inconvenience and cost of additional hardware required. It requires that all users purchase the hardware device. However, it has the advantage that once set up, it is easy to administer (as opposed to a manual password list that requires frequent updating for all users).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Identifying and Discouraging Unauthorized User Logins</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To improve security of a system against unauthorized user logins, systems often use some management techniques. Three such techniques are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Threat monitoring. </b>This technique detects security violations by checking for suspicious patterns of activity. For example, a system may count the number of incorrect passwords entered when a user is trying to log in, and after, say, three failed login attempts, the system notifies the security personnel by setting an alarm.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Audit logs. </b>In this technique, the system maintains a record of all logins. That is, for each login, it records such information as time of login, duration of login, accessed objects, and types of accesses made. When a user logs in successfully, the system reports some of the recorded information (such as time and duration) of previous login to the user. This helps the user to detect possible break-ins. After a user detects a security violation, he/she uses the audit log to identify the objects accessed by the intruder and the amount of damage done. This information is useful for recovery from damages done by the intruder.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2552">3. </a><b>Baited traps. </b>Often, systems also lay baited traps to catch intruders. For example, a system may maintain some special login names with easy passwords, such as login name: <i>user</i>, password: <i>user</i>. Whenever a user logs in using any of these names, the system immediately notifies the security personnel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Single Sign-on</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a distributed client-server environment, a user might have several client programs running on his/her host node that access different server programs on remote nodes. In such an environment, servers must authenticate the clients to ensure that they run on behalf of a legitimate user. If the system uses a simple password-based authentication scheme, the user will have to present his/her password each time a server wants to authenticate a client program running on his/her behalf. This is cumbersome and inconvenient because a user will certainly not want to enter a password</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">each time he/she accesses a new service. A simple way to solve this problem is to cache the user&#39;s password on his/her host computer and use it from the cache every time the user accesses a new service. This approach assumes that the user&#39;s own system is trusted and properly protected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part546.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part548.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
