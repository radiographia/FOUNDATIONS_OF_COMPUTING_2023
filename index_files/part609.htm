Few examples of such applications are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Computerized medical records (also called EHR - Electronic Health Record) management system. </b>It deals with defining standards for medical records and architectures for optimized acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of EHRs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2704">2. </a><b>Hospital Information System (HIS). </b>It deals with the use of computerized systems for management of all types of operations of a hospital including patient registration, scheduling, billing, clinical data records of patients, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Telemedicine system. </b>It enables patients to consult remote doctors for their medical problems using information and communication technologies. This is particularly useful for citizens living in rural areas where good doctors are not available. Using a telemedicine system, patients can consult doctors in super specialty hospitals located in big cities and seek medical advice/prescription from them. Such systems enable transfer of clinical data of a patient to a remote doctor for disease diagnostics and reply of the doctor&#39;s advice/prescription to the patient. The system also enables one-to-one interaction (if required) between the patient and doctor using video-conferencing facility.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Tele-education system. </b>It enables remote delivery of medical education to medical students or junior doctors. For example, the system can make a live broadcast of an operation happening in an operation theatre to a group of students sitting in a classroom at a remote location. Alternately, the system can enable an expert doctor to monitor on a computer screen the proceedings of an operation in progress by a junior doctor in a remote hospital, and allow him/her to advise the junior doctor remotely on what to do next.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Healthcare decision support systems. </b>They help healthcare service providers in better decision making. For example, a clinical decision support system assists doctors in analyzing a patient&#39;s real problem and in prescribing appropriate medicines.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Hand-held or portable medical devices. </b>They assist in data acquisition/access of medical data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Software tools for medical informatics applications development. </b>They enable use of medical standards (e.g., DICOM, HL7, etc.) and integration profiles in application development to facilitate exchange of information between independently developed medical informatics applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. <b>Clinical information system. </b>It deals with maintaining records of all types of clinical tests including radiology, pathology, and cardiology.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. <b>Rehabilitation information system. </b>It deals with maintaining records of rehabilitation patients including their rehabilitation history and progress of their recovery.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Several software packages are available today for medical informatics applications. For example, <i>Mercury </i>and <i>Sanjeevani </i>are telemedicine systems, <i>Sushrut </i>is a Hospital Information System (HIS), and <i>Ayusoft </i>is a decision support system for ayurvedic medicines and treatment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part608.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part610.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
