Hence, they have introduced several modified SDLC models, which are popularly known as <i>lightweight SDLC models</i>. These models address some or all of the drawbacks of the pure waterfall model. They are a compromise between no process and too much process. Some popular lightweight SDLC models are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Extreme Programming (XP)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Agile Software Process (ASP)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Adaptive Software Development (ASD)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. Feature Driven Development (FDD)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5. Rational Unified Process (RUP)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All lightweight SDLC models follow iterative approach of software development with overlapping phases. For example, code generation phase runs together with testing and debugging phase.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Lightweight SDLC models are also known as <i>agile development methods </i>because they are quite flexible in iterative refinement of the requirements, design, and generated code (unlike the rigid approach taken in the traditional SDLC model for freezing the requirements and design). For example, in agile development methods:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1427">1. Requirements can change any time during the project. The client is part of the project team and keeps giving feedback on requirements as things become clearer in various phases of development.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Code generation may start even before program specifications are fully ready and frozen. Team members start coding based on their understanding of the project from its requirement specification.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Team members might like to create test cases for unit testing or integrated testing from requirement specification even before actual coding starts. This provides quick way to test the software.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Team members might also like to create test cases for unit testing during code generation and run the test cases iteratively to refine the code.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Team members might like to evaluate the system several times before deployment of the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. Team members might like to review and refine the design and code repeatedly as they (team members including the client) meet periodically.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In short, the focus in agile development methods is more on deliverables than strict procedures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part223.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part225.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
