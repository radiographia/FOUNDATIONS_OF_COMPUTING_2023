They come in different sizes and capacities. Commonly used types of optical disks are CD-ROM, WORM (CD-R), CD-RW, and DVD. They are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CD-ROM</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">CD-ROM stands for <i>Compact Disk-Read-Only Memory</i>. It is a spin-off of audio CD technology</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and works much like audio CDs used in music systems. In fact, if your computer has sound card and speakers, you can play audio CDs in your computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">CD-ROM disk is a shiny, silver color metal disk usually of 5¼-inch (12 cm) diameter. It is made of polycarbonate plastic having thin layer of pure aluminum coating to make its surface reflective. For some good quality disks, gold layer is used. A thin layer of lacquer on top of the reflective surface protects it. It has storage capacity of about 650 Megabytes or 700 Megabytes in newer ones. It is so called because of its large storage capacity on a compact-size disk and because it is a read-only storage medium. That is, these disks come pre-recorded and a user cannot alter the information stored on them.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Since an optical disk mechanism reads a disk from the center to outer edge, several sizes are possible. Apart from the most common 120mm 74/80 minute disk having storage capacity of 650MB to 700MB, 80mm 21 minute disk (called Mini-CD) having 184MB storage is also available. They are usable with the disk drive of a 120 mm disk. Mini-CDs are available in various fancy shapes like round, oval, triangle, etc., while ensuring that the storage area is not affected.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The fact that a normal user cannot write data to a CD-ROM disk does not mean that this storage medium is not useful. In fact, many applications deal with huge volumes of data that rarely change. Hence, CD-ROM is preferable for such applications. For example, <i>infopedia </i>is a single CD-ROM disk that holds a complete encyclopedia, or a dictionary, or a world atlas, or a dictionary of quotations, or biographies of great people, or information about all educational institutions of a particular type in a country, etc. CD-ROM disk is often used for distribution of</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1136">1. Electronic version of conference proceedings, journals, magazines, books, etc.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. New software products</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Software upgrades</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">4. Multimedia applications such as video games, which involve integration of text, sound, graphics, motion video, and animation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For wide distribution and use of CD-ROM disks on different computers, the International Standards Organization (ISO) has evolved a standard for recording information on CD-ROM disks, called ISO 9660. This standard requires creation of a Volume Table of Contents (VTOC) on a disk, which allows storage and direct access of 1,40,000 files on the disk. This enables opening of any one of the 1,40,000 files with a single seek. Microsoft Corporation has developed MSCDEX (Microsoft CD Extension) software, which records data in ISO 9660 format on CD- ROM disks. All CD-ROM vendors have accepted the ISO 9660 format.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">WORM Disk/CD-Recordable (CD-R) Disks</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">WORM stands for <i>write-once</i>, <i>read-many</i>. WORM disks allow users to create their own CD- ROM disks by using a CD-recordable (CD-R) drive attached to a computer as a regular peripheral device. WORM disks look like standard CD-ROM disks, are available blank in market, and a user can encode on it using a CD-R drive. We can use any ordinary CD-ROM drive to read information recorded on a WORM disk by a CD-R drive. As the name implies, we can write data only once on a WORM disk, but can read it many times. However, we can write all desired data on a WORM disk in multiple recording sessions. The sessions after the first one</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">are always additive and cannot alter the etched/burned information of earlier sessions. WORM- disk-storage mechanism enables hiding of information added in a session in a subsequent session by creating File Allocation Table (FAT) at a new location, but the etchings on the surface are permanent (not removable). Such disk is called <i>Multi-Session Disk</i>. It uses laser beam technology (discussed earlier) for data recording/reading.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because of its permanent recording nature and large storage capacity, WORM disk is the preferred storage medium for archival applications, which now depend on microfilm, magnetic, or paper file media. <i>Data archiving </i>enables recording of old data on a secondary storage medium (such as a WORM disk) so that they can be deleted from the on-line storage device (such as a hard disk), thus freeing space for new data. WORM disk is also an ideal medium for making a permanent record of data. For example, many banks use them for storing their daily transactions. They write the transactions to a WORM disk, which becomes a permanent record for them (they can only read it whenever required, but can never alter).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">CD Read/Write (CD-RW) Disk</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A CD Read/Write (CD-RW) disk is similar to a WORM disk with the exception that we can erase its previous content and write on it multiple times. Such disks use metallic alloy layer. Laser beam changes the chemical property during writing (or <i>burn </i>process), changing reflectivity at desired places. The land-pit difference on CD-RW is not significant and hence CD drives have to be compatible to read such disks. A CD-RW disk usually has a lifetime of 100 or more erase-write cycle. CD-RW drives have the capability to change the chemical property again of the metallic alloy layer when we erase old data and write new data on a CD-RW disk. CD-RW disks are little expensive than CD-R disks, but offer great cost saving because of their erase and rewrite capability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Digital Video (or Versatile) Disk (DVD)</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1137">DVD is a standard format for distribution and interchange of digital content in both computer- based and consumer electronic products. The format enables storage of various types of large multimedia data on a new and improved version of CD (Compact Disk), which works on optical disk technology. That is, both DVD and CD store data by using pits embossed on a disk surface. However, these pits are about 4½ times as dense on a DVD as on a CD, and can store about seven times more data per side. The greater density is due to a more efficient data modulation scheme and error correction method that packs more data bits into every inch. DVD follows Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation Plus (EFMPlus) encoding as compared to Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation (EFM) encoding used by CD.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Physically, both DVD and CD are identical in both diameter and total thickness. There are two variants of DVD - single-layer disk and double-layer disk. Single-layer disk has storage capacity of 4.7GB, whereas double-layer disk has storage capacity of 8.5GB. A single-layer disk provides about 135 minutes of video playback at an average data rate of little less than 5 Megabits/second.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">DVD standard has two layers of specifications known as physical layer and logical layer. Physical layer specifications apply to the physical media itself, whereas logical layer specifications are for supporting all types of applications. The physical layer specification defines the following types of physical media:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">1. <b>DVD-ROM. </b>Users use it for mass distribution of pre-recorded software programs and multimedia.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">2. <b>DVD-RAM. </b>Users use it for general read-and-write applications in PC or consumer electronics domains.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. <b>DVD-R. </b>Users use it for low-cost, write-once recordable media.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. <b>DVD-RW. </b>It is a rewritable version of DVD-R.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, the logical layer specification defines recording formats for video and audio data for mass distribution of pre-recorded motion pictures and music. Key features of DVD- video and DVD-audio specifications are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>DVD-video. </b>DVD-video is now the most dominant movie storage format used. It allows storage of video in 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratios in MPEG-2 video format using NTSC or PAL resolution. NTSC has resolution of 720x480 and PAL has resolution of 720x576. The audio is usually Dolby Digital (AC-3) or Digital Theater System (DTS), and can be either monaural or 5.1 Surround Sound. In addition, it has multiple selectable language soundtracks and subtitles, voice-over commentaries by the movie&#39;s cast or director, and convenient random access to special features.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>DVD-audio. </b>It offers multiple choices of sampling rate and number of bits per sample. For super-high fidelity, the music producer might opt for two channels with 24-bit sampling at a rate of 192 KHz. Contrast the basic CD standard with its two channels and 16-bit sampling at 44 KHz. The specification also supports up to six channels of multichannel surround sound with 24-bit sampling at a 48 KHz rate. Besides the improved audio features, DVD-audio specification goes beyond CD by making provision for visual menus, still images, and video to accompany the audio program.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">DVD has enough space to store movie and support multi-lingual subtitles, multi-lingual audio, multiple camera angles, etc. It supports region marking to protect against piracy and use of DVD from one region to another. It also supports Content Protection for Pre-recorded Media (CPPM) security technique to safe guard against copying, etc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part143.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part145.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
