A language acceptable to a computer system is called <i>computer language </i>or <i>programming language</i>, and the process of writing instructions in such a language for an already planned program is called <i>programming </i>or <i>coding</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. All computer languages are broadly classified into three categories, namely; machine language, assembly language, and high-level language.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. A programming language that a computer understands without using a translation program is called its <i>machine language</i>. It is normally written as strings of binary 1s and 0s.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. A language that allows representation of instructions and storage locations by letters and symbols instead of numbers is called <i>assembly language </i>or <i>symbolic language</i>. A program written in an assembly language is called <i>assembly language program </i>or <i>symbolic program</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <i>Assembler </i>is a translator program that translates (converts) an assembly language program (source program) into its equivalent machine language program (object program).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. Machine and assembly languages are often referred to as <i>low-level programming languages </i>because they are machine dependent, they require the programmers to have a good knowledge of the internal structure of the computer being used, and they deal with machine-level coding, requiring one instruction to be written for each machine-level operation. <i>High-level programming languages </i>overcome these limitations of low-level programming languages.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <i>Compiler </i>is a translator program that translates (converts) a high-level language program (source program) into its equivalent machine-language program (object program).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. In addition to translating high-level language instructions into machine language instructions, compilers also detect and indicate automatically certain types of errors in source programs. We refer to these errors as <i>syntax errors</i>. A compiler, however, cannot detect <i>logic errors </i>in source programs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. <i>Linker </i>is a software tool that takes multiple object program files (modules) of any software and fits them together to assemble them into the software&#39;s final executable form, sometimes called <i>load module</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">10. <i>Interpreter </i>is a translator program that translates (converts) a high-level language program into its equivalent machine-language program. However, unlike a compiler that merely translates an entire source program into an object program and is not involved in its execution, an interpreter takes one statement of the source program, translates it into machine language instructions, and executes the resulting machine language instructions immediately, before taking the next statement for translation. The interpreter does not generate any object code of the source program.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. <i>Object-oriented programming </i>(OOP) deals with solving a problem by identifying the real- world objects of the problem and the processing required of those objects, and then creating simulations of those objects, their processes, and the required communications between the objects.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">12. Conventional <i>procedure-oriented programming languages </i>use procedural abstractions that encapsulate sequences of operations into procedures (also known as functions, subroutines, or subprograms). On the other hand, <i>object-oriented programming languages </i>encapsulate data as well as sequences of operations into abstract entities called objects, providing a stronger encapsulation mechanism than procedure. Hence, object-oriented programming  provides  a  more  powerful  modeling  tool  than  procedure-oriented programming.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">13. Today many different high-level languages are in use because each one was designed for a different purpose. Some of these are FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, Pascal, PL/1, C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ada, ALGOL, LISP, SNOBOL and PROLOG.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">14. Several characteristics believed to be important for making a programming language good are - simplicity, naturalness, abstraction, efficiency, structured programming support, compactness, locality, extensibility, and suitability to its environment.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">15. The factors that generally influence the process of selecting a programming language out of the many options available for coding an application are - nature of the application, familiarity with the language, ease of learning the language, availability of program development tools, execution efficiency, and features of a good programming language.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">16. We often use command statements to instruct a computer to do a job. A <i>scripting language </i>is a programming language that allows a programmer to integrate several such commands into a single command so that the programmer need not type all the commands every time he/she needs to perform the intended task. We refer to a program written in a scripting language as a <i>script</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">17. <i>Fourth-generation languages </i>(4GLs) are high-level programming languages that require</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the programmer to specify only “what” to do, not “how” to do it. The language processor of a 4GL automatically generates most of the procedure portion (steps to carry out a task) of a fourth-generation language program.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">18. A <i>procedural language </i>(such as C, C++, Java, COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC) is one that requires a programmer to spell out the steps in processing procedures needed to achieve a desired result. On the other hand, a <i>non-procedural language </i>(such as 4GLs) allows a user to specify “what” the output should be without describing all the details of “how” to manipulate the data to produce that result.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">19. We use a <i>markup language </i>primarily to format text documents. It uses a set of annotations (also called markup conventions) to indicate what format (such as font, style, and font size) to apply to each part of the text document.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">20. A few popular markup languages are Syntax for Generalized Markup Language (SGML), TeX and LaTex, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and eXtensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">21. <i>Interface Definition Language (IDL) </i>is a standard language for defining function and method interfaces for distributed or component-based applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">22. A <i>subprogram </i>is a program written in a manner that a programmer can use it in other programs whenever needed without rewriting. Other names used for it are <i>subroutine</i>, <i>subprocedure</i>, and <i>function</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">23. Two basic types of subprograms are procedures and functions. A <i>procedure </i>is a subprogram that performs an action but returns no value, while a <i>function </i>is a subprogram that returns a single value.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">24. Subprograms may be intrinsic or programmer-written. Intrinsic subprograms (commonly referred to as <i>built-in-functions</i>) are those provided with the language so that the programmer need only call them in a program to have them invoked automatically. On the other hand, programmers write <i>programmer-written subprograms </i>and use them whenever required.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">25. A specific user group often needs to extend a standard programming language to support the features needed frequently. However, since the original standard language does not support the extended features (additional statements), we need a language processor to translate the additional statements (extensions to the standard language) into a sequence of statements of the standard language before submitting the program to the standard language  compiler for compilation.  Such  a  language  processor  is  known  as  a <i>preprocessor</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">26. A language processor (software) that processes the result of computation obtained from a system/software to convert it in a specific format/style is known as a <i>postprocessor</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">27. Two popular types of postprocessors are data visualization postprocessor and CAD/CAM postprocessor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part340.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part342.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
