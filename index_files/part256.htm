These guidelines are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Precise Requirements Definition</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The designer of a software product must define its requirements precisely to ensure that the resulting product meets</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">users&#39; needs. Ill-defined software requirements lead to problems in the later phases of software life cycle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Modular Structure</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The designer of a software product must structure it in a modular fashion so that it is easy to program, implement, and maintain. A modular design helps in distribution of development task of different modules to different programmers, enabling development of the product in a shorter time. It also helps in easier testing, debugging, and maintenance of the product because respective teams can test, debug, and maintain individual modules independently. Designers can do feature enhancements by adding new modules.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Modular design also enables software reusability because if a module exists for a desired functionality, it can be used as it is, or with minor customization. Third party library routines are an example of reusable software modules.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Abstraction</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As far as practicable, a software product should use abstraction and information hiding. For example, in modular design, a programmer should implement each module in such a manner that its implementation details are hidden inside the module and only module interface is visible outside to allow other modules to interact with the module. Object-oriented programming takes care of this aspect of software engineering. Abstraction helps in easy reusability of existing modules because for reusing a module, a programmer needs to understand only its interface and not its internal details.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Uniformity</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A software product should maintain uniformity in design, coding, documentation, etc. Uniformity ensures consistency, which makes the product easier to develop and maintain, as well</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1482">as easier to learn and use. For example, if all graphical user interfaces of a software product follow a uniform style (providing the same look-and-feel throughout), it becomes much easier for a user to learn and use the software. Similarly, if all programmers working on different modules of a software project follow uniform coding and documentation styles, it becomes easier for someone else to understand and maintain the modules. Software organizations define/adapt and use several software engineering standards, such as design standards, coding standards, documentation standards, etc. to take care of this aspect of software engineering.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">CASE Tools</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Software tools play an important role in software engineering. They help in increasing professional capability and eliminate or reduce sources of error in software products. A large number of software tools are available to aid software developers in different phases of a software product&#39;s life cycle. In fact, popularity of these tools has resulted in a new area called <i>CASE </i>( <i>Computer Aided Software Engineering</i>). CASE tools provide a wide range of features for creation of better and more reliable software products within less time and with less effort. A few of the most common features are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Design specification tools </b>allow programmers to visually design screens, menus, database tables, reports, dialog boxes, and other key components of a program. With individual components defined, a programmer can link the components together and then test the operation of the program, without writing even a single line of program code.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Code generation tools </b>generate source code (programs) from the design specification of a software product. That is, once satisfied with the structure, design, and components of the product, a programmer can invoke a code generator, which creates the source code for the program automatically. Automatic creation of programs by the code generator also leads to error-free program codes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Testing and debugging tools </b>help programmers in testing and debugging of their programs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Source-code analysis tools </b>help in optimizing a program by pointing out unreachable lines of code and those functions that the program never uses (calls). They also assist in carrying out program changes consistently and uniformly by indicating, what other parts of a program would be affected by introducing a change in the program.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Documentation tools </b>assist in automatic generation of technical documents for a software product. For example, automatic flowchart generation tools create flowcharts for already written programs. Similarly, as a programmer uses a design specification tool to design the screens, menus, reports, dialog boxes, and other key components of a software product, a documentation tool collects this information for producing the product&#39;s documentation automatically.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Good CASE tools reduce much of the tedious work of creating a software product. Hence, they save several hours of time to get a new program up and running. They allow a programmer to concentrate on important functional parts of the program, rather than spending time in writing the code to display screens, dialog boxes, and menus. CASE tools, however, are not an answer for every situation. Even in case of software products that make extensive use of CASE tools during their development, some hand coding and manual documentation is necessary.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part255.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part257.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
