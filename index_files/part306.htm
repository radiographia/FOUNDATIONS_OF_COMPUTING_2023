We use a natural language, such as English, to communicate our ideas and emotions to others. Similarly, a programmer uses a computer language to instruct a computer what he/she wants it to do.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All natural languages (English, French, German, etc.) use a standard set of words and symbols (+, -, :, ;, &lt;, &gt;, etc.), which are understood by everyone using that language. The set of words allowed in a language is called its <i>vocabulary</i>. For example, the words used in English form the vocabulary of English language. Each word has a definite meaning. Similarly, every computer language has a vocabulary of its own. Each word in the vocabulary has a definite unambiguous meaning. The main difference between a natural language and a computer language is that natural languages have a large vocabulary, but most computer languages use a limited or restricted vocabulary. This is because a programming language by its very nature and purpose does not need to say much. Every problem to be solved by a computer has to be broken into discrete (simple and separate) logical steps comprising of four fundamental operations - input and output operations, arithmetic operations, operations for data movement within CPU and memory, and logical or comparison operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Every natural language has a systematic method of using the words and symbols in that language, which is defined by the grammar rules of the language. Similarly, we need to use the words and symbols of a computer language as per the set rules, known as <i>syntax rules, </i>of the language. In case of a natural language, one can use poor or incorrect vocabulary and grammar and still communicate his/her thoughts. However, in case of a programming language, unless a programmer strictly adheres to the syntax rules of the language, even down to the punctuation marks, a computer will not understand his/her instructions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1711">Over the years, programming languages have progressed from machine-oriented languages (that use strings of binary 1s and 0s) to problem-oriented languages (that use common mathematical and/or English terms). However, all computer languages are broadly classified into the following three categories:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Machine Language</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Assembly Language</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. High-level Language</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The nature and characteristics of these types of languages are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part305.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part307.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
