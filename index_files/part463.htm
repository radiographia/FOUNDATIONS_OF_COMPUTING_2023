Each manufacturer developed its own communication protocols for its networks. For</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">example, some earlier communication protocols of this type were SNA (Systems Network Architecture) by IBM, DNA (Digital Network Architecture) by DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation), BNA (Burroughs Network Architecture) by Burroughs Incorporation, DSN (Distributed Systems Network) by Hewlett Packard, and PRIMENET (Prime Computers Network) by Prime Incorporation. The main problem with this approach was that communication protocols of one network were not compatible with any other network. Moreover, standards of same network architecture also kept changing from time-to-time. For example, earlier versions of SNA were not compatible with its subsequent versions. Such incompatibilities started creating bottleneck in efficient and proper utilization of network resources.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recognized this problem and established a subcommittee to develop an international standard for network architectures. The result of this subcommittee&#39;s recommendations was the <i>Open System Interconnection </i>(OSI) model. It is a framework for defining standards for linking heterogeneous computers in a packet switched network. Hence, standardized OSI protocols made it possible for any two heterogeneous computers, located anywhere in the world, to communicate with each other.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 12.22<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows the architecture of the OSI model. Each layer of this seven-layer architecture defines a separate set of protocols and deals with one or more specific aspects of communication. Roles of these seven layers are described here.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In actual implementation of these seven layers, first three layers are likely to be in hardware, next two layers in operating system, presentation layer in library subroutines in user&#39;s address space, and application layer in user&#39;s program.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2242">Physical Layer</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Physical layer transmits raw bit streams between two nodes by converting sequence of binary digits into electric signals, light signals, or electromagnetic signals, depending on whether the two nodes are on a cable circuit, fiber-optic circuit, or microwave/radio circuit, respectively. Physical layer protocols decide electrical details, such as how many volts to use for 0 and 1, how many bits can be sent per second, and whether transmission can take place in one direction only or in both directions simultaneously. They also deal with mechanical details such as size and shape of connecting plugs, number of pins in plugs, and function of each pin. RS232-C is a popular physical layer standard for serial communication lines.</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="394" height="498" alt="image" src="Image_731.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2243">Figure 12.22. </a><span class="s21">Layers, interfaces, and protocols in the OSI model.

Sinha. © 1997 IEEE, USA].</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Data-Link Layer</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Physical layer transmits data between two nodes as raw bits. Data-link layer detects and corrects any error in the transmitted data. For this, it partitions a raw bit stream of physical layer into frames and performs error detection and correction for each frame independently. It also performs flow control of frames between two nodes to ensure that a sender does not flood a receiver with data by sending frames at a rate faster than the receiver can process.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2244">Network Layer</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Network layer sets up a logical communication path between two nodes. It encapsulates frames into packets and decides their transmission path from one node to another by using a high-level addressing and routing scheme. That is, routing is the primary job of network layer, and routing algorithm forms the main part of network layer protocols. Two popular network layer protocols are the <i>X.25 Protocol </i>and the <i>Internet Protocol </i>(called <i>IP</i>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <i>X.25 </i>is a <i>connection-oriented protocol</i>, which establishes a virtual circuit between the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">sender and receiver before actual communication starts between them. In this protocol, the sender first sends a request for connection to the receiver, which either accepts or rejects it. If it accepts the connection, the protocol generates a connection identifier and gives it to the sender for use in subsequent requests. During connection establishment phase, the protocol also decides a route between the two parties, which the communication system uses for transmission of subsequent traffic.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, IP is a <i>connectionless protocol</i>, which does not establish any connection between the sender and receiver before sending a message. It transmits each packet of the message independently, and different packets of the same message may take different routes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Notice that the network layer functions are primarily required in WANs. In a single LAN, the network layer is largely redundant because a LAN transmits packets directly from any node on the network to any other node.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Transport Layer</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Transport layer accepts messages of arbitrary length from session layer, segments them into packets, submits them to network layer for transmission, and finally reassembles the packets at destination. Some packets may be lost on the way from sender to receiver, and depending on routing algorithms used in network layer, packets may arrive at the destination in a sequence that is different from the order in which they were sent. Transport layer protocols include mechanisms for handling lost and out-of-sequence packets. For this, the transport layer assigns a sequence number to each packet, and uses sequence numbers for detecting lost packets and for reconstructing the packets of a message in correct sequence. Two most popular transport layer protocols are <i>Transport Control Protocol </i>(<i>TCP</i>) and <i>User Datagram Protocol </i>(<i>UDP</i>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">TCP is a connection-oriented transport protocol. It uses end-to-end mechanisms to ensure reliable, ordered delivery of data over a logical connection. It achieves these goals by using packet sequence numbers and positive acknowledgements with timeout and retransmission.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">UDP is a connectionless transport protocol. It is an unreliable protocol because, when it is used, message packets can be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order. Therefore, only those applications that do not need reliable communication should use UDP.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Session Layer</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Session layer provides the means of establishing, maintaining, and terminating a dialogue or a session between two end users. It allows the communicating parties to authenticate each other before establishing a dialog session between them. It specifies dialog type - one-way, two-way alternate, or two-way simultaneous - and initiates a dialog session, if message is a connection request message. Other services of session layer include quarantine service, dialog control service, and priority management service. Quarantine service buffers a group of messages on receiving side, until the session layer on sending side explicitly releases them. This is useful in database applications where a transaction (consisting of a group of messages) needs to be an atomic unit. Dialog control service is useful for dialog sessions in which user primitives used for sending and receiving messages are of the nonblocking type. In this case, a user may have multiple requests outstanding on the same session, and replies may come back in an order different from that in which the user sent the requests. Dialog control service reorders replies</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">according to the order of requests. Priority management service is useful for assigning priority to important and time-bound messages over normal, less-important messages. Session layer is not required for connectionless communication.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2245">Presentation Layer</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Presentation layer provides the facilities to covert message data into a form that is meaningful to communicating application layer entities. For this, it may perform on message data such transformations as encoding and decoding, code conversion, compression and decompression, encryption and decryption, depending on an application&#39;s requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Application Layer</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Application layer provides the services that directly support end users of the network. It is a collection of miscellaneous protocols for various commonly used applications such as electronic mail, file transfer, remote login, remote job entry, and schemas for distributed databases. Some popular application layer protocols are <i>X.400 </i>(Electronic Mail Protocol), <i>X.500 </i>(Directory Server Protocol), <i>FTP </i>(File Transfer Protocol), and <i>rlogin </i>(Remote Login Protocol).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part462.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part464.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
