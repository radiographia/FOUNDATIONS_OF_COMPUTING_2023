Software industry soon realized that managing the development of large software products and maintaining them is a difficult task. Software development projects frequently faced the problems of missed schedules, cost overruns, and low quality software products. Moreover, use of progressively larger software products in sensitive applications, where errors in software products could have severe and even life-threatening consequences, required correctness and reliability of software products to be of high degree. These quality and productivity demands for software products led to the introduction of systematic practices (later on known as software engineering practices) in software industry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part253.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part255.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
