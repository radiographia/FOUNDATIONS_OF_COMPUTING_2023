On the other hand, object-oriented programming languages encapsulate data as well as sequences of operations into abstract entities called objects, providing a stronger encapsulation mechanism than procedures. Hence, object-oriented programming (OOP) provides a more powerful modeling tool than procedure-oriented programming (POP).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Notice that we can consider both procedures and objects to be server modules that clients may call to get certain actions performed. However, the basic difference between the two is in their roles. The role of procedures is to transform input data specified by parameters into values, while the role of objects is to serve as a repository of data (current system state) and to respond (perform the requested action) in a manner determined by the current system state. For example, response of a bank to a withdrawal request depends on the value of current balance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="618" height="358" alt="image" src="Image_584.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1762">Figure 9.17. </a><span class="s21">Comparison of communication approaches in POP and OOP.

In POP, procedures call each other to receive, return, or update data values through parameter passing, as shown in the left half of the figure. In OOP, a number of interacting objects send messages to one another, as shown in the right half of the figure. Each object responds to a prescribed collection of messages. Each data item can be an attribute of an object or an object and is capable of processing requests known as messages. Thus, the data item or objects are the active computation unit, while the methods or operations are passive. Also, observe that we can</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">construct an object&#39;s method in much the same way as we construct a procedure (function) for a structured program by using the same three basic building blocks: sequence, selection, and repetition.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Procedure-oriented programming paradigm has strong organizing principles for managing actions and algorithms, but has weak organizing principles for managing shared data. Object- oriented programming paradigm has strong organizing principles both for managing actions and algorithms and for managing shared data because it provides the capability to restrict applicable operations to those associated with a specific object or class. Inheritance provides further strength to this capability by allowing classification of classes by factoring out properties common to several sub-classes into a super-class.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 9.18<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">provides a comparison of the features of POP and OOP.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="190" alt="image" src="Image_585.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1763">Figure 9.18. </a><span class="s21">Comparison of the features of POP and OOP.</span><a name="bookmark1764">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part324.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part326.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
