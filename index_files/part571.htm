An SA is a one-way connection (simplex connection) between two entities and has a security identifier associated with it. Hence, an SA allows data transfer in one direction only (sender to receiver). If two-way secure exchange of data is required (peer relationship), then two SAs are required, one for each direction.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">IPSec has the following two main parts:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. The first part is in the form of two new headers, which contain information about security identifier, integrity control data, and other information. Each packet has these two headers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. The second part is called ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol). It deals with establishing matching keys between two communicating entities to create a secure communication channel between them.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">IPSec supports the following two usage modes:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Transport mode. </b>In this mode, IPSec inserts the IPSec header just after the IP header, and modifies the “Protocol” field in the IP header to indicate that there is an IPSec header after the normal IP header. The IPSec header contains security information such as the SA identifier, a new sequence number, an integrity check of the payload (message content), etc. Typically, distributed systems use transport mode for end-to-end communication between two hosts (for example, a client and a server, or two workstations).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Tunnel mode. </b>In this mode, IPSec encapsulates the entire IP packet in the body of a new IP packet with a completely new IP header. The entire original (or inner) packet travels through a “tunnel” from one point of an IP network to another (no routers along the way are able to examine the inner IP header). In this way, it provides protection to the entire IP packet. Moreover, since the original packet is encapsulated, the new (larger) packet may have different source and destination addresses from that of the original packet. This further adds to the security.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tunnel mode is useful when one or both ends of an SA are a security gateway (such as a firewall or router) that implements IPSec. In this mode, the gateway encapsulates and decapsulates packets as they pass through it. Hence, a number of hosts on the networks behind firewalls may engage in secure communications without implementing IPSec. The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">unprotected packets generated by such hosts travel safely through external networks by tunnel mode SAs setup by the IPSec software in the firewall or secure router at the boundary of the local network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tunnel mode is also useful when a communication system aggregates several TCP connections and handles them as one encrypted stream. This is often done to prevent intruders from doing traffic analysis (study flow patterns of packets between different sources and destinations in a network) to draw certain inferences.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The main disadvantage of tunnel mode is that it adds an extra IP header, thus increasing packet size substantially. Transport mode does not affect packet size as much.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part570.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part572.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
