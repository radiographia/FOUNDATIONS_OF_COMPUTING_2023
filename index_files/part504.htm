We already presented some such applications while describing the benefits of IoT. We present here a few more such applications. It is only up to the imagination of a technologist, how he/she can design an IoT application to benefit its users.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. <b>Smart Home. </b>Modern homes extensively use IoT applications for home automation. For</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">example, consider the following scenarios:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. Temperature sensor in a room senses that the room temperature has gone up the threshold value set by the user. It signals the air conditioner to switch on. The air conditioner switches on and signals the window to close its glass panels. With the windows closed, the light intensity sensor senses that the intensity of light in the room has become lower than the threshold value set by the user, and it switches on the light. With windows closed, the audio sensor senses that the volume of TV in the room is now high and it signals the TV to reduce the volume. The TV reduces its volume, all this happening almost simultaneously, without any human intervention.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. A smoke detector or fire sensor in a house detects smoke/fire. It signals the windows to open its glass panels. It also makes a call to the telephone number of the fire station as well as to the house owner&#39;s mobile number stored in it.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are many such examples of IoT applications for home automation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2353">2. </a><b>Smart City. </b>Governments in various countries are building smart cities by using IoT applications for a variety of things like water distribution, traffic management, waste management, urban security, etc. IoT applications for smart cities help in reducing water wastage, noise pollution, air pollution, traffic congestion and make cities cleaner and safer to live. For example, consider the following scenarios:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. When the water level reaches nearly-empty or nearly-full threshold levels in water storage tanks, the water level sensors fitted in the storage tanks send signals to their respective water pumps, which automatically switch ON or switch OFF, depending on the type of signal received. This simple application avoids overflow of water storage tanks, and helps reduce water wastage.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. Sensors fitted in dustbins placed at various locations in the city sense the garbage level in the dustbins. When the garbage in a dustbin exceeds a threshold limit, its sensor sends signals to municipal corporation office, indicating that it is nearly full. The garbage collection officer then decides the size and frequency of the garbage collection truck to be sent in various zones of the city, by analyzing the signals received from dustbins of various zones. This simple application helps optimize the resources involved in garbage collection, and helps to keep the city cleaner with less effort.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are many such examples of IoT applications for building smart cities.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Smart Healthcare. </b>IoT applications for smart healthcare help both doctors and patients in offering and receiving better healthcare by enabling automatic health monitoring, remote health monitoring, and emergency notification systems. For example, consider the following scenarios:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. Smart watches worn on our wrist automatically measure certain health parameters and keep track of our lifestyle. Usually, a user using such a watch synchronizes it with his/her mobile phone and the watch periodically sends measured health parameters data (like BP, Pulse rate, etc.) and healthcare related advisories (like need to walk/exercise more) to the user&#39;s mobile phone. The user uses such data for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">corrective healthcare actions. The watch even notifies emergencies and user&#39;s location to the user&#39;s doctor, in case of any health-related emergency needing doctor&#39;s attention.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. Specialized sensors fitted in homes of elderly individuals or individuals with some type of disability continuously monitor the health parameters and activities of the individual. In case of any emergency (such as high fever, abnormal BP, falls, seizures, malfunction of specialized implants like pacemaker, etc.) the sensors notify the individual&#39;s doctor by making a phone call to him/her and providing some information regarding the type of emergency. On receiving such a notification, the doctor rushes or sends his/her team to attend to the individual. Properly programmed sensors also make voice notification (speak out) to the individual reminding him/her to take medicines or do some exercise when it is time to take medicine or do physiotherapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are many such examples of IoT applications for smart healthcare.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Smart Energy Management. </b>IoT applications for smart energy management help monitor and control energy usage at appliance level, building level, city level and even grid level to reduce consumption and wastage of power. For example, consider the following scenarios:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. All electric appliances, including lights, of a smart home when part of IoT, the owner of the house can remotely switch them ON or OFF. For example, on his/her way to office, the owner can check the status of each appliance/light on his/her mobile phone, and switch them OFF, if by mistake he/she has left them ON, while leaving the house. Similarly, if the owner wishes to switch ON an appliance remotely, while leaving office for home (like switching ON the geyser so that hot water is ready for bath as soon as the owner reaches home), he/she can do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. Light intensity sensors installed on street electric poles of a campus/city can automatically switch the light ON in the evening or OFF in the morning, by sensing the intensity of daylight and communicating with the switch installed with the light. This simple application helps to optimize power consumption by reducing wastage.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2354">There are many such examples of IoT applications for smart energy management. Smart energy meters also generate automated monthly bills and send energy bills to consumer&#39;s registered mobile phone.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Smart Transportation System. </b>IoT applications for smart transportation system help<i>Vehicle-to-Vehicle   (V2V)   communication</i>,<i>Vehicle-to-Infrastructure   (V2I) communication</i>, and <i>Vehicle-to-Person (V2P) communication</i>, to optimize transportation cost, improve transportation safety, and improve customer satisfaction. For example, consider the following scenarios:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. Aircrafts signal each other when they come too close while flying, avoiding mid-air collision.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. A few examples of IoT applications based on V2I communication are: (i) Electronic toll collection while a vehicle passes through a tollbooth (the vehicle need not stop for toll payment). (ii) An ambulance signals to traffic lights while approaching them</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">so that it gets green signals (the ambulance need not stop at traffic lights). (iii) A vacant parking space pole signals a vehicle when its driver is electronically searching for a vacant space in a large/multi-story parking lot.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">c. A company owns a fleet of cargo vehicles. It continuously monitors the location and condition of its vehicles using IoT applications, and takes corrective actions in case of exception conditions (such as accidents, delays, damages, thefts, etc.). This enables timely delivery of cargo with fewer cases of damage/theft reported, since the owner is able to monitor the movement and condition of its vehicles through GPS and sensors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are many such examples of IoT applications for smart transportation systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Smart Agriculture/Farming. </b>IoT applications in agriculture/farming have enabled precision farming, thus reducing wastage. For example, consider the following scenarios:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. Moisture content sensors help farmers know the exact time and quantity of water needed in soil for various types of crops, so that he/she does precise water irrigation, rather than irrigating the crops randomly, thus saving wastage of water.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. Pest control sensors help farmers know the exact region and type of infection in crops, so that he/she does precise insecticide spray, rather than spraying insecticide randomly, thus saving wastage of insecticide.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are many such examples of IoT applications for smart agriculture/farming.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Smart Manufacturing/Industry. </b>IoT applications in manufacturing/industry has given birth to the term <i>Industry 4.0 </i>(the Fourth Industrial Revolution). It refers to all types of automation happening in manufacturing/industry with the application of IoT. Properly designed IoT applications for manufacturing/industry can seamlessly integrate various smart manufacturing devices (that are equipped with sensors and networking capabilities) for automated control of plant and machinery, plant optimization, safety and security management, and various other functions. Even in construction industry, IoT applications can help in cost saving, time reduction, better performance of workers, paperless workflow and increased productivity. They can also be used for better scheduling of various activities in an efficient manner by coordinating tasks among various parties involved in the construction work.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part503.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part505.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
