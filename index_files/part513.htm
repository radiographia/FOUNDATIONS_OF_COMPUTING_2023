Animation is an important component of multimedia applications, because just as a picture is a powerful way to illustrate information, an animation clip is a powerful way to illustrate concepts involving movement. For example, in a multimedia</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2396">application for educating children (our previous example), an animation clip can effectively illustrate the difference between movements of a horse during gallop and walk. Without animation, it will be difficult to explain such concepts with still images and/or text only. Similarly, in a multimedia application for teaching swimming, an animation can more effectively illustrate proper ways to swing hands during swimming than that with images and/or textual description.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many people often confuse between animation and video (described later in this chapter) because both deal with the display of a sequence of images (frames) to generate an effect of motion. Note that animation is commonly used in those instances where videography is not possible or animation can illustrate a concept better than video. For example, it is not possible to videograph concepts such as collision between two stars, or movement of planets around the sun. Hence, a multimedia application designer often illustrates such concepts in his/her application with an animation clip. Similarly, a multimedia application designer can illustrate flow of blood in our arteries and veins, and pumping of blood by our heart with an animation clip. Advertisements, cartoon films, video games, and virtual reality applications also use animation. <i>Virtual reality </i>is a technology, using which, a user can put on a pair of goggles and a glove and tour a three-dimensional world that exists only in a computer, but appears realistic to the user.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Animation deals with displaying a sequence of images at a reasonable speed to create an impression of movement. Jerk-free full motion animation requires displaying of 25 to 30 frames per second. We saw in the previous section that a 640 x 480 image with 24-b color requires 7.4 Mbits of storage. Therefore, a one second animation requires 7.4 x 25 = 185 Mbits ≈ 23 Mbytes (185 ÷ 8) of storage. In general, an animation clip lasts for several seconds. Hence, animation files require much more storage space than graphic files having a single image. Moreover, to play an animation clip stored in a file on a secondary storage device like hard disk, it should be possible to read the data at required rate and transfer it through the bus to the frame buffer to display it on screen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hardware Requirements for Animation</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Normally, modern computers use the following hardware devices for animation processing capability:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Image generation tools and devices such as scanners, digital cameras, and video capture board interfaced to some standard video source like video camera or video recorder. Users use these tools to generate images for use in animation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. A computer monitor with image display capability and a graphics accelerator board. The latter controls the resolution and number of colors of display, and speeds up refresh rate. <i>Refresh rate </i>is the time taken to paint the computer screen with a new image frame, replacing previous image frame. Faster refresh rate smoothes out movements in an animation clip by avoiding flickering of animated sequences.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Software Requirements for Animation</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following software capabilities are desirable in a multimedia computer system with animation facility:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Animation-creation software. </b>It enables users to create animation sequences from scratch by using a mouse and various simple objects such as lines, circles, and polygons, with various supporting colors. For example, a user creates an animation sequence to illustrate bouncing of a ball by carrying out the following steps:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a. Selects a circle object and fills it with red color;</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">b. then starts the recorder of animation-creation software;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">c. then selects the red circle and drags it around the screen by using a mouse, recording several positions for it on screen (each time the user releases the mouse button, the system records object&#39;s position on screen);</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">d. finally, stops the recorder and uses save command to save the animation.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Now, to test the recorded animation, the user starts the player of animation-creation software and clicks on the red ball. The ball bounces across the screen following the positions recorded during the recording phase. The same bouncing sequence repeats every time the user clicks on the ball.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Screen-capture software. </b>It enables a user to take a snapshot of a computer screen display and capture it as a graphic image that the user can use in an animation clip.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Animation clips. </b>It is a library of animation clips. A user can directly import an animation clip from this library for use in a multimedia application. This saves lot of time and effort that the user might require otherwise to create or search a similar animation. This is also helpful, if a user does not have animation-creation software. An animation clips library often provides facilities to add a new animation clip or delete an existing animation clip from the library.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Animation file importing. </b>An animation file importing software enables a user to import animation files in some standard formats. Common animation file formats that such software support include .FLI and .FLC.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Software support for high resolution. </b>If animation sequences of a multimedia application use high-quality images, it is important to have not only the necessary hardware, but also software support for displaying high-resolution images. This requires software support for colors to maintain high quality of animation display.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Recording and playback capability. </b>It enables users to control recording and display of an animation sequence. For example, it provides options to ‘pause’ and ‘replay’ an animation sequence.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Transition effects. </b>It enables a user to make animations more interesting with transition effects such as fade-in and fade-out, layering, zooming, and rotation of objects.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part512.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part514.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
