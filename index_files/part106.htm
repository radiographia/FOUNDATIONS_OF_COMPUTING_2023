These operations are synchronized with the help of a built-in electronic clock (known as <i>system clock</i>), which emits millions of regularly spaced electric pulses per second (known as <i>clock cycles</i>). A processor fetches, decodes, and executes instructions at proper intervals with intervals timed by a specific number of clock cycles. One cycle is the time it takes to perform one operation such as moving a byte of data from one memory location to another. Normally, several clock cycles are required to fetch, decode, and execute a single program instruction. Shorter the clock cycle, faster the processor. Hence, the speed at which a computer executes an instruction depends on the computer&#39;s built-in <i>clock speed, </i>which is the number of pulses produced per second. We measure clock speed in <i>megahertz </i>(<i>MHz</i>) or <i>gigahertz (GHz)</i>, where mega means 10<span class="s22">6</span>, giga means 10<span class="s22">9</span>, and <i>hertz </i>means cycles per second. Over the years, clock speeds of processors have increased steadily. Most of today&#39;s personal computers have clock speeds in 500 MHz (0.5 GHz) to 4000 MHz (4.0 GHz) range. However, effort to build processors with even faster ratings continues. With all other</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">parameters being equal (although they never are), a CPU operating at 3 GHz can process data thrice as fast as one operating at 1 GHz.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Number of operations performed per clock cycle also affects CPU performance. Most CPUs perform one operation per cycle. However, the new processors use <i>superscalar architecture, </i>which can execute more than one instruction in each clock cycle. It achieves this by having multiple ALUs on a single CPU chip so that it can execute two or more instructions simultaneously.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Normally, we measure the processing speed of personal computers in MHz or GHz; that of workstations, mini computers, and mainframe systems in MIPS (Millions of Instructions Per Second) or BIPS (Billions of Instructions Per Second); and that of supercomputers in MFLOPS (Millions of Floating Point Operations Per Second), GFLOPS (gigaflops, which refers to a billion FLOPS), TFLOPS (teraflops, which refers to 10<span class="s22">12 </span>FLOPS), or PFLOPS (petaflops, which refers to 10 <span class="s22">15 </span>FLOPS). This is because personal computers generally employ a single microprocessor chip as their CPU, but the other classes of computers often employ multiple processors to speed up their overall performance. Thus, a workstation, minicomputer, or mainframe having a speed of 500-MIPS can execute 500 million instructions per second. Similarly, a supercomputer having a speed of 500 TFLOPS can execute 500 x 10<span class="s22">12 </span>floating-point operations per second. We measure the speed of supercomputers in terms of FLOPS because supercomputer applications, which are often scientific, frequently involve floating-point operations. Floating-point operations deal with very small or very large numbers, which require high precision data processing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part105.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part107.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
