Therefore, it is easier for a programmer to explain the logic of a program to others through a flowchart, rather than the program itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Effective analysis. </b>A macro flowchart, which charts the main line of logic of a software system, becomes the system&#39;s model that can be broken down into detailed parts for study and further analysis of the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Effective synthesis. </b>Normally, several programmers are associated with the design of a large software system, with each programmer being responsible for only a part of the entire system. Hence, if each programmer draws a flowchart for his/her part of design, the flowcharts of all programmers put together can help visualize the overall system design. At this stage, we can detect any problem in linking various parts of the system and modify the design accordingly. Thus, we often use flowcharts as working models in the design of new programs and software systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Proper  program  documentation.  </b>Program  documentation  involves  collecting, organizing, storing, and maintaining a complete historical record of programs, and other documents associated with a system. Good documentation is needed because:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">a. Documented knowledge belongs to an organization, and does not disappear with the departure (resignation/retirement) of a programmer.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">b. If an organization decides to postpone a project, documented work helps in restarting the project later from the stopped stage.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">c. When a programmer wants to modify an existing program, documented work provides him/her a more understandable record of originally done work.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Flowcharts, therefore, provide valuable documentation support.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Efficient coding. </b>Once a flowchart is ready, programmers find it easy to write the corresponding program because the flowchart serves as a roadmap for them. It guides them to go from the starting point of the program to the final point, without omitting any step. The result is an error-free program developed at a faster pace.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1568">6. </a><b>Systematic debugging. </b>A flowchart is helpful in detecting, locating, and removing mistakes (bugs) in a program in a systematic manner because programmers find it easier to follow the logic of the program in flowchart form. The process of removing errors (bugs) in a program is known as debugging.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Systematic testing. </b>Testing is the process of confirming whether a program does all its intended jobs under specified constraints. For testing a program, the testing team executes the program with different sets of data as input to test the different paths in program logic. For example, to test the complete logic of the program for Example 8.6, the following sets of data are necessary:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a. Data for a male student.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">b. Data for a female student, who scored less than 45%.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">c. Data for a female student, who scored exactly 45%.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">d. Data for a female student, who scored more than 45% but less than 60%.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e. Data for a female student, who scored exactly 60%.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">f. Data for a female student, who scored more than 60%.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">g. The trailer data having sentinel value.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A flowchart is helpful in designing test data for systematic testing of programs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Limitations</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In-spite-of their many advantages, flowcharts have the following limitations:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Flowcharts are time consuming and laborious to draw with proper symbols and spacing, especially for large complex programs. In this chapter, you have seen examples of small flowcharts developed for relatively small programs. You can imagine how difficult it would be to develop a detailed flowchart for a program containing over 50,000 statements.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Owing to the symbol-string nature of flowcharting, any change or modification in program logic usually requires a completely new flowchart. Redrawing a flowchart being a tedious task, many programmers do not redraw or modify the corresponding flowcharts when they modify their programs. This leaves a program and its flowchart in an inconsistent state. That is, the logic used in the program and that shown in its flowchart do</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">not match. This defeats the purpose of use of flowcharts as documentation support for programs. To take care of this problem, many companies use software tools that generate flowcharts automatically from program code. These software tools read a program&#39;s instructions and draw an equivalent flowchart of its logic. This backward approach draws flowcharts from program codes mainly for documentation purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. There are no standards determining the amount of detail that should be included in a flowchart.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because of such limitations, many organizations use alternative tools for representing the algorithms (logic) of their programs, two of which are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part279.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part281.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
