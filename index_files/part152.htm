Both SSD and HDD coexist in such systems. The following two configurations are commonly used (other types of configurations may also be used):</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Dual-drive system: </b>In this configuration, SSD and HDD are configured as separate drives (say, C: and D: drives respectively). Drive C: is used for storage of system files such as the operating system and system applications, whereas drive D: is used for storing user files. With this configuration, users get large storage space, whereas system performance gets better because booting of the system, performing system tasks, and launching of important applications becomes faster.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>SSD as cache and HDD as normal secondary storage: </b>In this configuration, SSD is invisible to users and is configured as a cache to store frequently used files. All files are stored on the HDD and cache replacement policy is used to transfer any required file from HDD to SSD, if it is not found in the cache (SSD) at the time of accessing it. The SSD also stores the boot program. Hence, this configuration helps to boot the system faster as well as to quickly access most of the needed files, as they are likely to be available in the cache. In this manner, it helps to speed up the overall system performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Several users are now also augmenting their system&#39;s secondary storage by buying portable SSD and storing their frequently used files on it. They purchase a system with cheaper HDD having large storage capacity and then purchase a smaller capacity portable SSD and use it by plugging it to I/O port of their computer as and when required.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part151.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part153.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
