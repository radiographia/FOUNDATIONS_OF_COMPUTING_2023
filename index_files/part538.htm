The most common types of damage that active attacks cause are corrupting files, destroying data, imitating hardware errors, slowing down a system, filling up memory or disk space with garbage, causing a system to crash, confounding a receiver into accepting fabricated messages, and denial/delay of message delivery. Computer virus, worm, and logic bomb are three commonly used types of active attacks. They are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Viruses</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2532">A </a><i>computer virus </i>is a piece of code attached to a legitimate program that, when executed, infects other programs in the system by replicating and attaching itself to them. In addition to this replicating effect, a virus normally does some other damage to the system, such as corrupting/erasing files. Due to its spreading nature, a virus can cause severe damage to a system. Notice that virus attacks are active-type Trojan horse attacks.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Typically, a virus works as follows. An intruder writes a new program, which performs some interesting or useful function (such as some game or utility). The intruder then attaches the virus to this program in such a way that when a user executes the program on his/her system, the viral code also executes. The intruder now uploads this infected program to a public bulletin board system, or sends it by email to other users of the system, or offers it for free or for a nominal charge. Now if anyone uses the infected program on his/her system, its viral code also executes. The viral code randomly selects an executable file on the hard disk of the system and checks if it has already infected the file. Most viruses include a string of characters that acts as a marker to indicate if the virus has already infected the program. If the virus detects that it has already infected the selected file, it selects another executable file. When it finds an uninfected program, it infects it by attaching a copy of itself to the end of that program and replacing the first instruction of the program with a jump to the viral code. When the program finishes execution of the viral code, it executes the instruction that had previously been first and then jumps to the second instruction so that the program now performs its intended function. Notice that a virus spreads in a system because every time the system executes an infected program, the program tries to infect more programs. Also, notice that a virus does not infect an already infected file in order to prevent an object file from growing ever longer. This allows the virus to infect many programs without noticeably increasing disk space usage.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recovery from a virus infection is a difficult task. Curing a computer system, which is under virus attack, often requires partial or complete shutdown of the system. Therefore, it is always better to take necessary precautions to prevent virus problems. Some precautionary steps include:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Buying software only from respectable stores.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Refusing to accept software in unsealed packages or from untrusted sources.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">3. Avoiding borrowing programs from someone whose security standards are less rigorous than one&#39;s own.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">4. Avoiding uploading of free software from public domain, bulletin boards, and programs sent by email.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The owner/administrator of a computer system, which suffers from virus infection, needs to cure it. The simplest way to cure a computer from virus infection is to shut it down, purge its memory and all its disks, and rebuild its files from scratch using the original manufacturer&#39;s copy. The owner/administrator may also use disinfection utilities to cure the system. Disinfection utilities software first identifies the type of virus that has infected the computer by matching its marker against the markers of well-known viruses. Once it knows the type, it uses the corresponding disinfection utility to restore the original programs from their infected versions by applying a detailed knowledge of the infection method used by the virus. For example, in viruses that modify jump instructions at the beginning of the host program, the software performs recovery by restoring the original jump to the start of the host program code. However, notice that these disinfection utilities can only cure specific known viruses. They cannot cure a newly encountered type of virus. Normally, a good disinfection utility can cure several hundred types of viruses and its vendors regularly improve its power by frequently updating it whenever they come to know about new viruses.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The longer a virus remains in a system, the more time it gets to spread, and recovery from it becomes tougher. Therefore, it is important to detect a virus as soon as possible. An effective method to detect viruses is to use a snapshot program and a check routine. The snapshot program logs critical system information at the time of initial installation and periodically executes a check routine to compare the system&#39;s current state with the original snapshot. If it detects signs of infection, it identifies the affected area of the computer, and notifies the user.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Worms</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2533">Worms are programs that spread from one computer to another in a network of computers. They spread by taking advantage of the way in which a computer network shares resources and, in some cases, by exploiting flaws in the standard software, which computer networks use. A worm program may perform destructive activities after arrival at a network node. Even when not directly destructive, worms often cripple a network by subverting the operation of computers on the  network  to  their  own  purposes,  monopolizing  their  resources,  and  saturating  the communications links in a network. Often, it is necessary to shut down the entire system (all computers of the network) to recover from a worm problem.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To illustrate how a worm propagates in a network, we describe here the famous Internet Worm attack by a Cornell graduate student, Robert Tappan Morris, on November 2, 1988, which infected thousands of UNIX machines all over the Internet. This worm program had two types of code, the bootstrap code, and the code forming the main body of the worm. The worm compiled and executed the bootstrap code on the system under attack. When executed, the bootstrap code established a communications link between its new host and the machine from which it came, copied the main body of the worm to the new host, and executed it. Once installed on a new host, the worm&#39;s first few actions were to hide its existence. For this, it unlinked the binary version of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">itself, killed its parent process, read its files into memory and encrypted them, and deleted the files created during its entry into the system. After finishing its hiding operations, the worm&#39;s next job was to look into its host&#39;s routing tables to collect information about other hosts to which its current host is connected. Using this information, it then attempted to spread its bootstrap code to those machines by trying the following three methods one by one:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. The first method was to try to spawn a remote shell on the target machine using the <i>rsh </i>command of UNIX. This method sometimes works because some machines trust other machines and willingly run <i>rsh </i>without authenticating the remote machine. If successful, the remote shell uploaded the worm program on the target machine and continued spreading to new machines from there.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. If the first method failed, the worm tried the second method. This method took advantage of a bug in the <i>finger </i>program that runs as a daemon process at every BSD site. A user anywhere on the Internet can type</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 182pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">finger user_name@host_name</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to obtain general information about a person at a particular site, such as the person&#39;s real name, home address, office address, telephone number, and so on. The <i>finger </i>utility uses the C library function <i>gets </i>to read input data. A problem with <i>gets </i>is that it reads the entire input string without checking for buffer overflows. The worm exploited this flaw and called <i>finger </i>with a specially constructed 536-byte string as a parameter. The overflow caused overwriting of an area of the system stack, allowing the worm to put its own suitable instructions (a procedure to execute <i>/bin/sh) </i>on the stack. Now when the <i>finger </i>daemon returned from the procedure it was in at the time it got the request, it returned to and executed the procedure inside the 536-byte string on the stack instead of returning to <i>main. </i>If this method succeeded, the worm had a shell running on the target machine.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. If the first two methods failed, the worm tried a third method, which took advantage of a loophole in the UNIX electronic mail utility <i>sendmail. </i>The <i>sendmail </i>program has a <i>DEBUG </i>option, which allows program testers to verify that mail has arrived at a site without having to invoke the mailer&#39;s address resolution routines. Many vendors and site administrators leave the debug option compiled into the <i>sendmail </i>code to facilitate configuring the mailer for local conditions. What the worm did was to execute the <i>sendmail </i>program with the <i>DEBUG </i>option and then enact a sequence of commands to mail the bootstrap code to the target machine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Once established on a new machine, the worm tried to break into user accounts by exploiting the accessibility of the UNIX password file and the tendency of users to choose common words as their passwords. Each broken password allowed the worm to masquerade as the user corresponding to that password and gain access to any remote machine where that user had an account.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The worm acted intelligently to prevent being spotted. It periodically <i>forked </i>itself and killed its parent, so that its process ID was constantly changing. This prevented any one process from accumulating a large amount of CPU time that might create suspicion or cause degradation of its scheduling priority. Furthermore, after every 15 hours, the worm erased its record of the machines it had infected, so that already infected hosts were back on the list of potential targets. Whenever the worm gained access to a new machine, it first checked to see if the machine</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2534">already had a copy of the worm. If so, the new copy exited, except one time in seven. The use of one in seven possibly was to allow the worm to spread even on a machine on which the system administrator might have started its own version of the worm to fool the real worm.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although viruses and worms both replicate and spread themselves, the two differ in the following aspects:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. A virus is a program fragment whereas a worm is a complete program in itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Since a virus is a program fragment, it resides in a host program, runs only when the host program runs, and depends on the host program for its existence. On the other hand, a worm can exist and execute independently.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. A virus spreads from one program to another whereas a worm spreads from one computer to another in a network.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Logic Bombs</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A logic bomb is a program that lies dormant until some trigger condition causes it to explode. On explosion, it destroys data and spoils system software of the host computer. A trigger condition may be an event such as accessing a particular data file, a program being run a certain number of times, the passage of a given amount of time, or the system clock reaching some specific date (for instance, Friday the 13<span class="s22">th </span>or April Fool&#39;s Day). Normally, the intruder selects the trigger condition tactfully to cause the logic bomb to explode at the time when it can do maximum damage to the system. An intruder can embed a logic bomb in a Trojan horse or a virus can carry a logic bomb.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Active Attacks Associated with Message Communications</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A distributed system uses communication channels to carry information from one node to another in the form of messages. These communication channels are often insecure component of a distributed system. Hence, intruders often breach security of a distributed system by observing, modifying, deleting, inserting, delaying, redirecting, or replaying the messages that travel through its communication channels. Usually, the following types of active attacks are associated with message communications:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Integrity attack. </b>For secure communication, integrity requirement specifies that a receiver of a message must receive the message exactly as the sender sent it, or the system should report a discrepancy. However, an intruder may change the contents of a message while it is traveling through a communication channel and the receiver may not be aware of this and accept it as the original message.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Authenticity attack. </b>An intruder may illegally connect his/her own computer system to a communication channel of a distributed system and impersonate a legal network site. The intruder can then synthesize and insert bogus messages with valid addresses into the system so that the system delivers them as genuine messages. If an integrity attack is possible, an intruder may also cause an authenticity attack by changing the protocol control information (addresses) of the messages so that the system delivers them to wrong destinations.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Denial attack. </b>In this case, an intruder blocks communication path between two processes completely or partially. For example, with complete blocking of the path, it can prevent the two processes from communicating at all. On the other hand, it may observe all messages exchanged between the two processes and prevent selected messages from delivery. That is, the intruder causes complete or partial denial of message delivery.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2535">4. </a><b>Delay attack. </b>Several messages have time value. Therefore, instead of using a denial attack, an intruder may simply delay the delivery of messages in an association between two communicating processes to fulfill his/her motive.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Replay attack. </b>In this case, an intruder retransmits old messages, which recipients accept as new messages.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cryptography <span class="p">deals with the encryption of sensitive data to prevent its comprehension. It is the only practical means to protect attacks associated with message communication. This is because an encrypted message provides no information about the original message, hence guaranteeing secrecy; and an encrypted message, if tampered with, would not decrypt into a legal message, hence guaranteeing integrity. Cryptography also enables secure identification of communicating entities, hence guaranteeing authenticity. Furthermore, encryption, in conjunction with protocols, enables prevention of denial, delay, and replay of messages. For instance, a communication protocol can counter replay of old messages by using nonce or timestamp. A </span>nonce <span class="p">(such as an OTP - One Time Password) is guaranteed, fresh information, which the system has not used before. Therefore, a reply that contains some function of a recently sent nonce is timely because the system can generate the reply only after it generates the nonce. Perfect random numbers are suitable for use as nonce. In summary, the only way to prevent attacks associated with message communications is by the application of cryptographic techniques.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part537.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part539.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
