Four commonly used database models are hierarchical, network, relational, and object- oriented. Also known as <i>database structures </i>or <i>database structuring techniques, </i>they are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hierarchical Databases</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part411.htm#bookmark2058" class="s23">A hierarchical database links its data elements as an inverted tree structure (root at the top with branches formed below). Below the single-root data element are subordinate elements, each of which, in turn, has its own subordinate elements, and so on. The tree can grow to multiple levels. Like a family tree, data elements of a hierarchical database have parent-child relationship. A parent data element is one that has one or more subordinate data elements. Data elements that are below a parent data element are its children data elements. There may be many children elements under each parent element, but there can be only one parent element for any child element. Note that the branches of a tree structure are not connected. </a><a href="part411.htm#bookmark2058" class="s3">Figure </a>11.7<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows an example of a hierarchical database.</span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part411.htm#bookmark2058" class="s23">Several database applications use hierarchical database because they can neatly organize their data elements as a hierarchical tree structure. However, the main limitation of a hierarchical database is that it does not support flexible data access. In a hierarchical database, applications can access its data elements only by following paths formed by the branches of the tree structure. Hence, a hierarchical database designer must determine all types of relationships among data elements and map them in a hierarchical tree structure while designing the database. For example, the hierarchical database of </a><a href="part411.htm#bookmark2058" class="s3">Figure </a>11.7<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">categorizes employees by their department and within a department by their job functions, such as managers, engineers, technicians, and support staff. If personnel department faces shortage of support staff on a day, an application cannot directly produce a list of all support staff, to take a decision to use some support staff from other departments in personnel department. Instead, the application will have to traverse the database tree department-by-department and obtain the list of support staff assigned to each department, and then consolidate the obtained lists to generate a list of all support staff.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2060"><span><img width="480" height="185" alt="image" src="Image_660.jpg"/></span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2058">Figure 11.7. </a><span class="s21">An example of a hierarchical database.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Network Databases</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A network database is an extension of hierarchical database. It also organizes its data elements in such a manner that they have parent-child relationship among them. In a network database, however, a child data element can have more than one parent element or no parent element at all. Due to this structure, the database management system of a network database permits extraction of needed information by beginning from any data element, instead of starting from the root data element. Like in hierarchical database, a network database designer must also determine all types of relationships among the data elements while designing the database.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part411.htm#bookmark2059" class="s3">Figure </a>11.8<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows an example of a network database, which maintains relationships among the courses offered and the students enrolled for each course in a college. Notice that parent and child elements can have many-to-many relationships. That is, a student may enroll for several courses, and a course may have a number of students enrolled for it. With this database structure, an application can easily produce both course-wise-student report (a report showing all students enrolled for each course) and student-wise-course report (a report showing all courses taken by each student). For example, it is easy to tell from the figure that in this semester, the students enrolled for Mathematics course are Seeta, Geeta, Ram, and Sohan; and Geeta has taken three courses - Hindi, Mathematics, and Computer Science. The example also shows a child element that has no parent element (student named Raju - he might be a research student who has not taken any course in this semester).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="496" height="198" alt="image" src="Image_661.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2059">Figure 11.8. </a><span class="s21">An example of a network database.</span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Relational Databases</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A relational database organizes its data elements as multiple tables with rows and columns. It stores each table as a separate file. Each table column represents a data field, and each row represents a data record (also known as a <i>tuple</i>). A common field links data in one table (or file) to data in another table.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part411.htm#bookmark2061" class="s3">Figure </a>11.9<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows an example of a relational database, which is a sample library database. It has three tables - first one contains data of library members, second one contains data of borrowed books, and third one contains data of books in the library. The library issues a library card to each new member with his/her membership number on it. When the library issues a membership card, it uses an application to enter the member&#39;s name, address, and membership number in the first table. When a member borrows a book, the library uses the application to enter borrower&#39;s membership number, book&#39;s ISBN number (which serves as unique identification number for a book), and due date for returning the book in the second table. ‘Membership No.’ common field links the first and second tables, whereas ‘Book No.’ common field links the second and third tables.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 109pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="347" height="508" alt="image" src="Image_662.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2061">Figure 11.9. </a><span class="s21">An example of a relational database.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part411.htm#bookmark2063" class="s23" name="bookmark2062">Now, let us assume that the librarian wants a report of overdue books as on 10-11-2022, and wants borrower&#39;s details and book&#39;s details for each overdue book in the report. To produce this report, the database search routine will first search for the due date field in borrowed books data table to surface three overdue books. The database management system will then use ‘Membership No.’ field to cross-reference borrower&#39;s details of each overdue book from members’ data table, and ‘Book No.’ field to cross-reference book&#39;s details of each overdue book from books data table.

Many applications can organize their data elements in a relational database in a manner that is identical to real-life relationships between data elements. Hence, users often find relational database model to be closer to their intuitive model of real-life situations, making this model easier to understand and use. Moreover, for adding new data to an existing relational database, there is no need to redesign the database afresh. Rather, users can add new tables containing new data to the database, and can then link these tables to existing tables with common key fields. Users can also reorganize data elements, when necessary, to create new tables by selecting certain rows or specific columns from other tables, or by joining columns and rows from two separate tables.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Object-oriented Databases</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hierarchical, network, and relational database models (henceforth referred to as conventional database models) are suitable for conventional business data processing applications, such as inventory control, payroll, accounts, employee information systems, etc. Application designers have found them unsuitable for a variety of other types of applications because of several shortcomings in them. These applications include computer-aided design (CAD), computer- aided engineering (CAE), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided software engineering (CASE), expert systems, and multimedia systems. Some key features that these applications require for effective modeling are (these features are absent in conventional database models):</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Ability to model complex nested entities, such as design and engineering objects, and multimedia documents. Conventional database models do not provide mechanisms, such as configuration management, to represent and manage such entities.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. Support for general data types found in object-oriented programming languages. Database</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">management systems based on conventional database models support only a limited set of atomic data types, such as integer, string, etc. They do not even allow storage and retrieval of long unstructured data, such as images, audio, and textual documents.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2064">3. Support for frequently useful object-oriented concepts such as object, class, inheritance, etc. Object-oriented concepts consist of a number of data modeling concepts, such as aggregation, generalization, and membership relationships, which are useful in modeling complex applications. Database management systems based on conventional database models do not provide necessary functions for implementing object-oriented concepts. This means that applications programmers must explicitly represent and manage objects and the relationships among the objects in their programs.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Support for proper match between object-oriented programming languages and database languages. Normally, an application programmer implements a database application by using some conventional programming language (such as COBOL, PASCAL, C, or C++), and some database languages (data definition language, data manipulation language, query language) that are part of database management system. With popularity of object- oriented paradigm, use of object-oriented programming languages for implementing applications has become a common practice. However, conventional database languages (which database management systems of conventional database models support) do not use object-oriented concepts for implementing applications. This mismatch between object-oriented programming languages and conventional database languages makes database implementation of many applications inconvenient.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Object-oriented database model overcomes these shortcomings of conventional database models. An <i>object-oriented database </i>is a collection of objects whose behavior, state, and relationships are in accordance with object-oriented concepts (such as object, class, class hierarchy, etc.). An <i>object-oriented database management system </i>allows definition and manipulation of an object- oriented database.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Application designers prefer to use object-oriented database model for a large range of database applications such as CAD, CAE, CAM, CASE, expert systems, and multimedia systems. The reason is that object-oriented concepts already include such data modeling concepts as grouping of objects into a class, aggregation relationships between an object and other objects it consists of (nested objects), and generalization relationships between a class of objects and classes of objects specialized from it. The fact that an object-oriented database model includes the aggregation and generalization relationships means that an object-oriented database management system provides direct support for the definition and manipulation of the relationships among objects. This in turn means that application programmers need not program and manage these relationships explicitly.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part411.htm#bookmark2065" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">11.11</span> shows an example of an object-oriented database structure.

Class <i>Vehicle </i>is also root of a class hierarchy involving classes <i>TwoWheeler </i>and <i>FourWheeler</i>. Class <i>Company </i>is, in turn, root of a class hierarchy with subclasses <i>DomesticCompany </i>and <i>ForeignCompany</i>. It is also root of a class-composition hierarchy involving class <i>Employee</i>.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part411.htm#bookmark2065" class="s23">For the database structure of </a><a href="part411.htm#bookmark2065" class="s3">Figure </a>11.11<span class="p">, a typical query may be “List President&#39;s and Company&#39;s names for all companies that manufacture two-wheeler vehicles and are located in Pune, India”.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="414" height="265" alt="image" src="Image_664.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2065">Figure 11.11. </a><span class="s21">An example of an object-oriented database structure.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part410.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part412.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
