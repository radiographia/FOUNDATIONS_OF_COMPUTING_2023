Some of these are as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Multimedia Books and e-Books</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia books use audio, animation, and video to enrich text and still images of printed books, and provide better understanding of the subject matter. They also provide a variety of search mechanisms to enable a user to quickly search for facts. Due to these reasons, several reference books such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, telephone directories, etc. are now available in soft copy form as e-books, which allow users to quickly access the information they need. Today, many journals, magazines, newspapers, and product manuals are available in electronic form, which enable users to access and print only the articles/portions of their interest. e-Book is an extension of this idea in which an on-line book shop makes a book&#39;s contents available in soft copy form for interested users to buy its soft copy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Digital Library</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A <i>digital library</i>, which is a repository of large information in digital form, allows multiple users</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to search and access information of their interest from it. Such a library (being virtual in nature because it stores the books only in soft copy form and not physically) remains open round the clock, allowing users to access information from it at their own convenient time. With remote connectivity (direct or via the Internet) to the digital library server computer, there is no need for a user to physically come to the library for using it. This overcomes the distance and time limitations of conventional libraries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2413">Multimedia Presentation</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia applications can present information in a variety of forms (text, graphics, animation, audio, video) involving use of our multiple senses. Hence, multimedia presentation can explain a subject matter more effectively than conventional presentation to an audience, because it enhances a person&#39;s comprehension capability. It is extremely effective in getting across new ideas and concepts. Moreover, it helps in making a presentation more interesting, and has inevitable effect of grabbing and holding a person&#39;s attention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Foreign Language Learning</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Using a book for learning a foreign language is difficult because the learner is not sure how to pronounce the words written in textual form. Such a book often has an accompanying audiotape or CD to solve this problem, but it is inconvenient for a learner to keep rewinding the tape to find specific information. Moreover, the learner does not have the flexibility to quickly hear the pronunciation of a specific word. Using a multimedia program that incorporates text and sound, a learner can see the words and phrases on the screen as the program pronounces them. The learner also has the flexibility to request the computer to pronounce any word by selecting that word on screen (say by clicking over it). The program may have additional features to assist in faster learning process. For example, the program may allow a learner to point to a word/phrase on screen to display a translation for it in his/her native language.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural Learning Environment</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multimedia course materials provide a natural learning environment because they allow different learners to learn and proceed at their own pace of learning. For example, beginners may like to spend more time on basic concepts, while advanced learners may like to skip rudimentary information and go to advanced concepts directly. A multimedia course material uses hypertext and hypermedia technologies to support this feature. With this facility, learners find the learning environment more interesting and motivating for faster learning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Training</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Employee training is an important aspect of any organization. An organization often needs to impart training to its employees on the processes, products, and services of the organization. Many organizations use interactive multimedia training programs for this purpose. A computer- based training has many advantages. It allows an employee to take training at his/her own convenient time. For example, an employee on night shift can learn as conveniently as those working during the day. Moreover, an employee can pause the training at any time to attend to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">some other more important work, and resume when his/her schedule allows. These training programs often use multimedia tools to enhance their effectiveness. For example, they often use hypertext and hypermedia technologies to allow different employees to learn at their own pace of learning. Employees working in remote offices and plants of the organization can also undertake the same training over the network without the need to come physically to the head office.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part516.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part518.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
