For example, users use workstations commonly for computer-aided design (CAD), simulation of complex scientific and engineering problems, visualization of results of simulation, and multimedia applications such as for creating special audio-visual effects in movies or television programs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A workstation is similar to a high-end PC, and typically, only one person uses it at a time (like a PC). Characteristics used to differentiate between the two are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Processing power. </b>Processing power of a workstation is more than that of an average PC.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Storage capacity. </b>Workstations have larger main memory (typically few tens of GB) as compared to PCs (typically few GB). Hard disk capacity of a workstation is also much more (typically few TB) as compared to that of PCs (typically few hundreds of GB).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Display facility. </b>Most workstations have a large-screen monitor (21 inch or more) capable of displaying high-resolution graphics. PCs normally use monitors having smaller screen (19 inch or less).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Processor design. </b>PCs normally use CPUs based on CISC technology, whereas workstations use CPUs based on RISC technology.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Operating system. </b>Unlike PCs that run any desktop OS, all workstations generally run server version of Windows, Mac OS, Linux or UNIX operating system. Unlike most operating  systems  for  PCs  that  are  single-user  oriented,  operating  systems  for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">workstations support multi-user environment, making them suitable for use as a server in network environment.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Expansion slots. </b>Workstations usually have more expansion slots than PCs providing greater flexibility of supporting additional functionality. For example, a workstation can have two or more NICs plugged into it to enable it to communicate on two different networks (say, Ethernet and ATM).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Workstations generally cost from few lakhs to few tens of lakhs of rupees depending on configuration. Some manufacturers of workstations are Apple, IBM, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard (HP).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part23.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part25.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
