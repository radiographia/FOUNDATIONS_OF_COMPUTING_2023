The act of sending a spam e-mail is known as <i>e-mail spamming </i>and a person who performs such an act is known as an e<i>-mail spammer</i>. 80 to 90% of all e-mail messages generated in the world on a daily basis are spam e-mails. E-mail spammers often obtain e-mail addresses of e-mail users by scanning Usenet postings, stealing Internet mailing lists, or searching the Web for addresses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Why E-mail Spammers Send Spam E-mails?</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There may be various reasons for this such as:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Commercial reasons. </b>Most spam e-mails are commercial advertising, often for dubious products, get-rich-quick schemes, or quasi-legal services.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Religious reasons. </b>Many spam e-mails contain religious preaching messages sent by people who want to spread their religion.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Political reasons. </b>Often politicians use spam e-mails at the time of elections to send their political views and thoughts to masses.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Malicious reasons. </b>Some malicious intruders use spam e-mails to transmit viruses, worms, or spyware on others computers and cause problems to them.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Criminal reasons. </b>Sometimes, criminals use spam e-mails to commit crimes. For example, criminals use such e-mails to lure people to locations where they kidnap them, hold them for ransom, and even murder them.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Spam e-mails cost little to spammers to send because e-mail is a cheap medium for mass communication. E-mail spammers who use e-mail spamming for advertising have no operating costs beyond the management of their mailing lists. It is also difficult to hold spammers accountable for their mass mailings. Moreover, professional spammers have automated their process of sending spam e-mails to a high degree, making their task simple. Hence, e-mail spammers find e-mail spamming to be profitable even if the response rate is low to their spam e- mails.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Why are Spam E-mails Harmful?</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There may be various reasons for this such as:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. An e-mail user has to spend his/her valuable time and effort in reading and/or deleting unsolicited e-mails in his/her mailbox.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. An e-mail user often finds it annoying to go to his/her mailbox and to look through a whole list of e-mails there to find only a few legitimate e-mails among them.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Spam e-mails often fill a recipient&#39;s mailbox with unsolicited e-mails. If the mailbox quota is of fixed size, the e-mail system may refuse to accept even solicited e-mails of the recipient after the mailbox is full.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Spam e-mails often cost money to a recipient. Many recipients use measured phone service to receive or read their mails, while the meter is running. Spam e-mails cost them additional money, which they would not like to spend.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Handing and transmission of spam e-mails cost money to the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and online services, and they transmit these costs to the subscribers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2607">6. Spam e-mails used for criminal reasons or for commercial advertising of dubious products/services are harmful to those who are lured by them.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. Spam e-mails used for transmitting viruses, worms, or spyware are harmful to recipient&#39;s system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hence, e-mail spamming has been widely criticized, and pressure to make e-mail spamming illegal has been successful in some parts of the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Anti-spam Software</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Spam e-mails are a matter of concern to e-mail users world over. Researchers have proposed several approaches (known as <i>anti-spam techniques</i>) for automatic elimination of unwanted e- mails. Software vendors have embedded many of these techniques into their anti-spam software products/services to make them easy to use. End-users (or system administrators) use anti-spam software to protect themselves (or their organization&#39;s employees) from spam e-mails. Some popular anti-spam software are<i>SpamAssassin, Bogofilter, DSPAM, Mailwasher, SpamEaterPro</i>, <i>SPAMfighter, SpamKiller</i>, and <i>SpamBuster</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Normally, anti-spam software is judged by the following features:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. It should be easy to install and use even for an inexperienced user.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. It should be customizable. For example, a user should be able to set rules about which e-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">mails he/she wants to receive, reject/delete, put in a certain folder, or quarantine for the user to look through at his/her own discretion.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3. It should have high degree of accuracy in protecting e-mail users from unwanted e-mails.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. While accuracy is important, it should also have a good balance between false negatives and false positives cases. <i>False negatives </i>are cases in which the software allows (accepts) some unwanted e-mails (spam e-mails) to enter a user&#39;s mailbox. <i>False positives </i>are cases in which the software prevents (rejects) some legitimate/wanted e-mails (also called <i>hams</i>) from entering a user&#39;s mailbox. Users are less bothered about false negatives because they can delete them manually. However, users are often concerned about false positives because some legitimate e-mails are important, even urgent, in nature. Users do not want to lose even those legitimate e-mails, which are merely conversational. Hence, most anti-spam software allow a user to save rejected e-mails in a temporary (spam) folder, which the user can review later.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. It should work with various types of e-mail services and Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) such as <i>Sendmail, Qmail, Procmail, </i>and <i>Fetchmail</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anti-spam software products use one or more of the following techniques for automatic elimination of unwanted e-mails:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>White list with challenge-response. </b>A <i>white list </i>is a configurable list of addresses approved by a user from which the user agrees to receive e-mails. The software allows e- mails received only from these addresses to enter the user&#39;s mailbox. For all other e-mails, the software generates a special challenge-response message and sends it to the sender. The challenge-response message contains the e-mail&#39;s unique ID (generated by the software) and instructions for the sender to reply for inclusion in the white list. When a legitimate sender answers a challenge, the software adds his/her address to the white list, so that it allows all future e-mails from this address.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The problem with this approach is the extra burden of challenge-response that it places on new legitimate senders. If a legitimate sender fails to respond to the challenge message (for some reason), the sender&#39;s e-mail becomes a type of false positive. Moreover, in many automated e-mail systems, legitimate senders are machines (not people) with no capability to answer a challenge. This approach, therefore, requires extra efforts to deal with mailing-list signups, on-line purchases, Web site registrations, and other automated e-mail correspondences.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2608">2. </a><b>Distributed adaptive black lists. </b>By definition, a spam e-mail goes to a large number of e-mail users. If a user&#39;s system is unable to filter and reject it, the e-mail enters the user&#39;s mailbox. It will enter the mailbox of all such users. Each such user must delete the e-mail manually from his/her mailbox to get rid of it. Distributed black list filters let one user&#39;s “Delete” operation for deleting a spam e-mail warn millions of other users that the e-mail is a spam e-mail. Maintainers of distributed black list servers frequently create “honey- pot” addresses for attracting spam e-mails (but never for legitimate correspondences).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The problem is that false negatives are far more common with this approach than with any other approach. In addition, since distributed black lists require talking to a server to perform verification, the performance of the approach is poor.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Rule-based rankings. </b>This is the most popular approach used for filtering spam e-mails.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The software using this approach evaluates a large number of patterns (mostly regular expressions) against the contents of a received e-mail and calculates a score for the e-mail. Some matched patterns add to the score, whereas others substract from it. For example, detecting a keyword such as “viagra” or “porno” would add to the score. If an e-mail&#39;s score exceeds a threshold value, the software filters/rejects it as a spam e-mail; otherwise, it accepts it as a legitimate e-mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The approach works effectively when correctly tuned to the types of legitimate e-mails of a user. However, it results in false positives in many situations, such as, when it detects the keyword “cialis” (a word that normally adds to the score) in the word “specialist”.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Bayesian word distribution filters. </b>This approach works on the general observation that some words occur more frequently in known spam e-mails, while other words occur more frequently in legitimate e-mails. Hence, the approach uses well-known mathematics to generate a “spam-indicative probability” for each word, and a simple mathematical formula to determine the overall “spam probability” for an e-mail based on the collection of words it contains. It accepts or rejects an e-mail based on the value of its “spam probability”.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This approach has the following benefits:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. It does not require human effort in developing rules for filtering e-mails. It can automatically generate a filter from the corpora of e-mails categorized as spam and legitimate.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">b. It is easily implementable with few lines of code.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">c. A user can customize it for his/her requirement (characteristic) of spam and legitimate e-mails.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">d. It provides good accuracy of identifying spam e-mails.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e. It is simpler and faster than other approaches.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part567.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part569.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
