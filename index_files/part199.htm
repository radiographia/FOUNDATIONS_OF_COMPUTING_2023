A voice response system has an audio-response device that produces audio output. Obviously, the output is temporary, soft-copy output. Voice response systems are of two types - voice reproduction system and speech synthesizer. They are described here.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Voice Reproduction System</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A voice reproduction system produces audio output by selecting an audio output from a set of pre-recorded audio responses. The set of pre-recorded audio responses may include words, phrases, or sentences spoken by human beings, music or alarms generated by musical instruments, or any other type of sound. The system first converts the analog recordings of the pre-recorded sounds into digital data and stores them on a disk or in its memory chip permanently. To produce an audio output, the system selects the corresponding sound from the set of pre-recorded sounds. It then converts the selected sound back into analog form and routes it to a speaker.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Several applications use voice reproduction systems, including the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Audio help for guiding how to operate a system. For example, banking industry uses voice reproduction systems in automatic teller machines to provide systematic guidance to customers on how to transact with the bank by using an ATM.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Automatic answering machines. For example, automatic answering machines often take care of telephone enquiries for new telephone numbers in place of old numbers, or vacancy status of a flight/train.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Manufactures of video games make them exciting and interesting by playing an event- based sound from a set of pre-recorded sounds.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Talking alarm clocks. For example, every hour the clock speaks out what is the time by selecting the voice message corresponding to that hour from the set of pre-recorded voice messages. In addition, the clock may speak “its time to wake up” at the time set for alarm.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">5. Talking toys and home appliances also use a voice reproduction system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speech Synthesizer</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A speech synthesizer converts text information into spoken sentences. To produce speech, it combines basic sound units called <i>phonemes</i>. From a given text information, it combines the sequence of words into phonemes, amplifies it, and produces the output through a speaker.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Several applications use speech synthesizers, including the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. For reading out text information to blind persons. For example, we can scan a recently published book using a scanner, convert it into text using OCR software, and then a speech synthesizer can read it out to blind persons. This allows blind persons to know the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">latest information published in a book as soon as it is printed, rather than wait for the book to appear in Braille.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. For allowing those persons who cannot speak, to communicate effectively. For example, a person with this type of disability types the information he/she wants to communicate to another person, and the speech synthesizer converts it into spoken words.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. For translation systems that convert an entered text into spoken words in a selected language. For example, a foreign tourist in India may enter a text he/she wants to communicate to an Indian, and the speech synthesizer converts it into spoken words of the selected Indian language.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part198.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part200.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
