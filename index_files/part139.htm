They come in different sizes, use different types of packaging, and are made of rigid metal or flexible plastic. Their size ranges from 1 to 14-inch diameter. Commonly used sizes are 1.0 inch, 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch. The disks are packaged individually or in multiples in cartridges or contamination-free containers. Depending on the type of packaging, magnetic disks are classified into Zip/Bernoulli disks, Disk packs, and Winchester disks (see </a><a href="part139.htm#bookmark1122" class="s3">Figure </a>5.18<span class="p">). They are described here.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 138pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="271" height="70" alt="image" src="Image_357.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1122">Figure 5.18. </a><span class="s21">Broad classification of magnetic disks.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1123">1. </a><b>Zip/Bernoulli disk. </b>It consists of a single hard disk platter encased in a plastic cartridge. Depending on the disk drive and size of disk, storage capacity varies from a few GB to few tens of TB. Its disk drive, called <i>zip drive, </i>may be of portable or fixed type. The fixed type is part of a computer system, connected to it permanently. A user can bring and connect the portable type to a computer system for the duration of use, and can then disconnect and take it away. We can load/unload a zip disk into a zip drive, just as we insert/remove a video cassette in a video cassette player.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Disk pack. </b><a href="part139.htm#bookmark1124" class="s23">It consists of multiple (two or more) hard disk platters mounted on a single central shaft. All disks revolve together at the same speed. Its disk drive has a separate read/write head for each usable disk surface (recall that when a disk device uses multiple disks, the upper surface of the topmost disk and the lower surface of the bottommost disk are sometimes not used). The disk drive is of interchangeable type and allows users to load/unload different disk packs whenever required. When not in use, a user stores a disk pack off-line in a plastic case (see </a><a href="part139.htm#bookmark1124" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">5.19</span>). This gives virtually unlimited storage capacity to disk packs. Depending on the disk drive, size of disk, and number of disks in a pack, storage capacity of a single disk pack varies from a few TB to few hundred TB.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 156pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="267" height="105" alt="image" src="Image_358.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1124">Figure 5.19. </a><span class="s21">A disk pack.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Winchester disk. </b>A Winchester disk consists of multiple (two or more) hard disk platters mounted on a single central shaft. However, unlike a disk pack drive, a Winchester disk drive is of fixed type. That is, its hard disk platters and disk drive are sealed together in a contamination-free container and cannot be separated from each other. Hence, Winchester disks have limited capacity. However, for the same number of disk platters of the same size, Winchester disks have larger storage capacity than disk packs due to the following reasons:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. As the disk platters and disk drive are sealed together permanently, all surfaces of all disk platters (including the upper surface of the topmost platter and the lower surface of the bottommost platter) are used for data recording. That is, for a Winchester disk with four platters, there are eight usable surfaces as opposed to six surfaces in case of a disk pack with four platters.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. Contamination-free environment allows Winchester disks to employ greater precision of data recording and accessing, resulting in greater data storage density than interchangeable disk packs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part138.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part140.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
