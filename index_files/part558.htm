It is configured to implement some security policy (set of rules), which defines what kinds of interactions (flow of information) are permitted between the two networks.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part558.htm#bookmark2586" class="s23">Typically, an organization uses a firewall to connect its LAN to the Internet (see </a>Figure 15.14<span class="p">).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The organization&#39;s LAN is a trusted network and the Internet is an untrusted network. Hence, the firewall prevents a malicious attacker on the Internet from entering the organization&#39;s network and accessing the organization&#39;s computing resources and information. Although it is possible to protect each computer of the organization individually by installing security features on each one of them, this is not practical when the number of computers in the organization is large. This is because any change in security policy of the organization will require security features upgrades on many computers. Hence, firewall is a widely accepted practical approach, in which an organization configures one computer/ communication device to protect all its computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As a firewall can screen traffic flowing both into and out of the trusted network, some organizations also configure their firewalls to control what their employees do on the Internet. For example, they prevent employees from engaging in activities such as:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Wasting their time in browsing the Internet during office hours</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Using services that undermine organization&#39;s security</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Leaving organization&#39;s “footprints” in awkward places</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="166" alt="image" src="Image_819.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2586">Figure 15.14. </a><span class="s21">A firewall protects users/systems of a trusted network from users/systems of an untrusted network.</span><a name="bookmark2587">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s21" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">It also prevents users of trusted network from doing unwanted things on the untrusted network.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An organization uses a firewall not only to connect the organization&#39;s LAN to the Internet, but also for other purposes such as for connecting production and R&amp;D networks (R&amp;D network needs higher degree of security), or for connecting their networks to their business partners&#39; networks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part557.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part559.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
