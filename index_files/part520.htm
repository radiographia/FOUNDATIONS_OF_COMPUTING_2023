With the advent of new multimedia applications, scientists and engineers are now using computers as a more effective tool than before for carrying out their work. Few examples of use of multimedia applications in science and engineering are as follows.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Computer-Aided Design (CAD)</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">CAD is an application of generative graphics. Nowadays, CAD packages are available for designing a variety of things - cars, aircrafts, ships, buildings, printed circuit boards, etc. In fact, modern design engineers and architects must have knowledge of CAD because they can be far more productive in their design work with CAD tools than with pencil and paper. Use of a CAD system for designing an object allows a designer to create an electronic model of the object by</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">describing all its three dimensions. The designer can display any view of the object on computer screen to see it from different perspectives. On paper, the designer needs to draw a different drawing for each view, and has to redraw all affected views for any change in the design.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2421">Visualization of Experimental Results</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Visualization deals with exploring data and information in a form that is easier to comprehend. Many computer applications deal with large data sets. With numerical representation of data, a user often finds it difficult to extract relationships among different parts of the data. However, by representing the same data in a form that is easier to comprehend, a user can visualize such relationships much easily. For example, if there is a data table showing change in pressure with change of temperature in an experiment, a user can visualize this relationship much easily by representing the same data in the form of an (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) graph. Special visualization tools are available that enable multimedia representation of large and complex data sets, assisting scientists and engineers in better analysis of their experimental/simulation results.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part519.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part521.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
