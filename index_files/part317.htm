However, large size software often consist of several thousands, even several millions, of lines of program code. For such software, it is impractical to store its entire source code in a single file due to the following reasons:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">1. Large size of the file makes it difficult, if not impossible, to work with. For example, loading the file for compilation on a computer with limited main memory capacity may</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">not be possible. In addition, editing the file may be tedious and time-consuming.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Deploying multiple programmers to work concurrently for developing the software within specified time becomes difficult.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. We need to recompile the entire source program whenever we make any change in the source program, no matter how small. Recompilation of large source programs is often a time-consuming process.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To take care of these problems, software developers adapt a modular approach to develop any reasonably sized software. In this approach, they divide the software into functional modules and write separate source programs for each module. Often, they do not need to write source programs for some of the modules because they can find programs offering same functionalities in an already available program library. Software developers maintain these library programs in their object code form.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In modular approach of software development, software consists of multiple source program files. We can modify and compile each source program file independent of other source program files to create a corresponding object program file. In this case, we use a program called <i>linker </i>to combine all object program files (modules) of the software, and to convert them into a final executable program, which is sometimes called <i>load module</i>. Hence, a <i>linker </i>is software that takes multiple object program files (modules) of some software and fits them together to assemble them into the software&#39;s final executable form.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part317.htm#bookmark1741" class="s3">Figure </a>9.11<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">illustrates the process of compiling multiple source program files of various modules of software and linking them to create its executable program (load module). Note that since converting the source programs into an executable program is a two-step process, when we modify the software, we need not recompile all the source programs. Rather, we need to recompile only the changed source programs to produce new object programs for them. We can then use the linker to create a new executable program by reassembling the newly created and the old object programs and library modules.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="500" height="210" alt="image" src="Image_577.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 167pt;text-indent: -153pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1741">Figure 9.11. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating the process of compiling multiple source program files and linking them to create the executable program (load module).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Linkers are part of the development environment (which consists of a set of program development tools including compilers) of a computer system.
