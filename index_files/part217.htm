If we can find a software package that meets our requirements, purchasing it is the best option. We follow the following steps in selecting and buying a pre-written software package:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. Prepare a list of all available software packages that can perform the desired task(s).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. From this list, select those software packages only that meet the system specifications. For example, we should check for compatibility with user&#39;s available/planned hardware, I/O devices, Operating System, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Now choose the best one (based on factors such as supported features, duration of warranty support, cost, etc.) from the list of those selected in Step 2.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Now find out the source from where you can purchase the chosen software at the cheapest price. Different vendors offer different discount rates on the list price, and selecting the best vendor in terms of price and after-sale support is important.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Following are the advantages and limitations of buying a pre-written software package:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Pre-written software packages usually cost less because many customers share their development and maintenance cost.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. With a pre-written software package, a user can start the planned activity almost immediately. The user need not wait for the software to be developed and tested. This may be important, if the development and testing efforts involve several months.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3. Pre-written software packages are usually general purpose, so that they can meet the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">requirements of as many potential users as possible. Due to this, many times, the operating efficiency and capability to meet the specific needs of a user more effectively is not as good for pre-written software packages as for in-house developed software packages.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part216.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part218.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
