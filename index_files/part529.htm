In addition to keyboard, mouse, and display screen, it has a TV tuner and a remote control (see </a><a href="part529.htm#bookmark2450" class="s3">Figure </a>14.18<span class="p">). Of course, it also has a powerful graphics processor based display card, large memory, fast hard disk with large storage space, and a digital surround soundboard. It has an easy-to-read and visually attractive graphical user interface (GUI), which is easy to operate even for a person who has no experience of working on a PC. It is as easy to use as a TV.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="370" height="153" alt="image" src="Image_781.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2450">Figure 14.18. </a><span class="s21">A media center PC.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Apart from other facilities, a media center PC normally provides the following functionalities:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. It serves as a PC.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. It serves as a TV.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. It enables not only viewing of TV programs, but also allows a user to pause and record live TV programs. For example, if a telephone call or doorbell interrupts a user while he/she is viewing a TV program, the user can pause the program, attend to the call, and can start viewing the program again without missing out a single dialogue or scene. In such a situation, the user can also fast forward through the advertisements to catch up with the live TV program.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. It provides Electronic Programming Guide (EPG) feature that tells a user what is playing on what channel and when during the next few days. With EPG feature, a user can search for his/her favourite program(s), and in case the user is not around at that time, he/she can set a recording so that the system records the program for the user to view it at his/her own convenience. This feature also enables the user to record entire series of his/her favourite program (such as all episodes during the week of a serial drama). This feature is dependent on area and subscribed services.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">5. It allows a user to chat with his/her friends while watching TV on the same screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. It serves as a music system with enhanced features. A user can create his/her own digital music library of songs in the system and can play favourite songs from the library without the hassle of changing CDs. As the system has a CD drive, a user can also play songs from a CD or record/copy songs on a CD.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">7. It serves as a radio. It enables not only listening to radio programs, but also allows a user</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to pause and record live radio programs and listen to them at his/her own convenience.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. It serves as a digital photo album. It serves not only as storage of digital pictures, but also allows a user to index, edit, and view them with added features (zoom, rotate, auto advance, etc.).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2451">9.

It serves as multimedia data editing and enhancement tool. A user can use this feature to create customized multimedia content for future use. For example, a user can create a customized music by mixing other already available music files. Similarly, a user can create a customized video or animation by combining available clips and photographs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. It serves as DVD/VCD player and recorder. A user inserts a DVD/VCD in DVD/VCD drive of the system to play/record multimedia data on it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">12. It serves as a videogame gadget such as playstation/gameboy. It enables children to play computer games. It also enables them to play Internet games with other users over the network.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Any PC with good graphics display card, multimedia components, and a TV tuner card can serve as a media center PC by installing media center applications on it. Some operating systems provide features of media centre applications integrated into OS itself. Such operating systems are called <i>media center OS</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part528.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part530.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
