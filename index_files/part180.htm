An important issue in HSS is how to decide which data should reside on which storage tier at what point of time, and when and how to move data from one storage tier to another. With the huge volume of data handled by today&#39;s storage solutions, it would be a nightmare if this required human intervention. Fortunately, <i>Hierarchical Storage Management </i>(<i>HSM</i>) software automatically handles this. Hence, all HSSs have HSM software, which monitors the way data is used, and makes decisions as to which data can be moved safely to slower devices (near-line storage) and which data should stay on fast devices (on-line storage). In a typical scenario, HSM stores frequently used data on on-line storage, but eventually moves them to near-line storage, if the system does not access them for a certain period, typically a few months. If the system accesses a data on near-line storage, HSM moves it back automatically from near-line storage to on-line storage. The advantage is that since only rarely used data is on near-line storage, most users do not notice any slowdown in data access. Moreover, users do not need to know or keep track of where the accessed data is stored and how to get it back.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The computer retrieves the data automatically. Notice that movement of data to/from off-line storage still requires human intervention because a human operator has to insert or connect an off-line media or device to the computer system for initiating data transfer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part179.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part181.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
