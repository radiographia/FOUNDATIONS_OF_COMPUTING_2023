A customer makes on-line purchases of goods or services offered on the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Issuer. </b>An issuer issues payment cards to customers. Usually, it is a financial institution (such as a bank) supporting electronic payment and SET. An issuer is responsible for making actual payment for purchases made by a customer against a valid payment card issued by the issuer. It maintains accounts for customers to whom it issues payment cards.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Shopkeeper. </b>A shopkeeper is an individual or organization that has arrangements (Website, e-mail, etc.) for on-line selling of products or services to customers. Shopkeepers accept payments from customers through payment cards, and for this they have an account with an acquirer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Acquirer. </b>It is natural for a shopkeeper to accept payments made using payment cards from multiple issuers. However, a shopkeeper does not want to deal with multiple individual issuers because their number is large. Hence, an acquirer serves as an intermediate entity between issuers and shopkeepers. An acquirer is a financial institution that maintains accounts for shopkeepers and has network connection with issuers&#39; financial processing systems. When a customer makes card payment to a shopkeeper, the acquirer provides authorization to the shopkeeper that the specified card number is valid and that the proposed purchase does not exceed the credit limit (in case of credit card) of the customer. The acquirer also provides electronic transfer of payments to the shopkeeper&#39;s account for the purchase. Subsequently, the issuer of the payment card used in this transaction reimburses the acquirer for electronic funds transfer over a payment network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Payment gateway. </b>It is a specially configured system interfacing between SET and the existing payment card networks for authorization and payment functions. Usually, the acquirer or a designated third party owns it, and it has network connection with the acquirer&#39;s financial processing system. A shopkeeper exchanges SET messages with the payment gateway over the Internet, while the payment gateway processes the messages and interacts with the acquirer&#39;s financial processing system to enable electronic transfer of payment to the shopkeeper&#39;s account.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Certification Authority (CA). </b>SET assumes availability of PKI infrastructure having a hierarchy of CAs (discussed later in this chapter). A CA is a trusted entity that issues X.509v3 public-key certificates to customers, shopkeepers, and payment gateways.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part581.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part583.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
