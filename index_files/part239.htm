Requirement specification document states these objectives. The evaluation team normally consists of those people who have independent viewpoint (are not part of the development team). While evaluating a system, the evaluation team considers the following points:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Performance evaluation. </b>The evaluation team evaluates the performance of the new system by comparing it with that of the old system. Generally, the new system should be at least as efficient as the old one. If the evaluation team reports any slack, the development team analyzes the reason, and if possible, incorporates necessary changes in the new system to rectify it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Cost analysis. </b>The evaluation team does cost analysis to verify whether cost estimates done for various phases of the project during the planning phase match with the actual cost incurred in each phase. In case of discrepancies, cost analysis helps in finding out the reasons. This knowledge is useful in making correct cost estimates for future systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Time analysis. </b>The evaluation team does time analysis to verify whether time estimates done for various phases of project during the planning phase match with the actual time taken in each phase. In case of discrepancies, time analysis helps in finding out the reasons. This knowledge is useful in making correct time estimates for future systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>User satisfaction</b><i>. </i>The evaluation team does user satisfaction analysis to verify things such as - How useful is the system for users? How enthusiastic they are about the service they receive? Do they receive outputs in time to take necessary action? The morale of people using or affected by the new system is a good measure of the success of the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Ease of modification. </b>All systems need modification due to one or more of the reasons mentioned in the next section. Hence, the ease with which a programmer can modify a system to incorporate the suggested changes is also an important parameter to judge the quality of the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Failure rate. </b>The quality of a system also depends on its failure rate. A system that fails frequently cannot meet its objectives successfully. Hence, it is of poor quality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part238.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part240.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
