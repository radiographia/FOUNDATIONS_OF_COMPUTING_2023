Various types of printers described earlier are not suitable for meeting this output requirement of such applications. Hence, such applications use plotters. A <i>plotter </i>is an ideal output device for architects, engineers, city planners, and others who need to generate high precision, hard-copy, graphic output of varying sizes. The two types of plotters in common use are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Drum plotter. </b><a href="part195.htm#bookmark1304" class="s23">It consists of a drum, one or more penholders mounted perpendicular to the drum&#39;s surface, and a graph-plotting software. The drum rotates in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions to produce vertical motion. The pen(s) clamped in the holder(s) moves left to right or right to left to produce horizontal motion. The graph-plotting software controls movements of the drum and pen(s). Hence, under software control, the drum and pen(s) move simultaneously to draw designs and graphs on a sheet placed over the drum. The plotter can also annotate a design or graph so drawn by drawing characters of various sizes with the pen. Since each pen is program selectable, a user can use the plotter to produce multi-colored designs by mounting pens having ink of different colors in different holders. </a><a href="part195.htm#bookmark1304" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.34</span> shows a drum plotter.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Flatbed plotter. </b><a href="part195.htm#bookmark1305" class="s23">It consists of a rectangular flatbed table, one or more penholders mounted perpendicular to the table&#39;s surface, and a graph-plotting software. It plots a design or graph on a sheet of paper spread and fixed over the table. Normally, the paper does not move and the pen holding mechanism provides all types of motions necessary to draw complex designs and graphs. Hence, under software control, the pen(s) move in the required manner to draw designs and graphs on the sheet placed on the flatbed table. The plotter can also annotate a design or graph so drawn by drawing characters of various sizes with the pen. Provision is also there to mount more than one pen in the pen(s) holding mechanism. Since each pen is program selectable, a user can use the plotter to produce multi-colored designs by mounting pens having ink of different colors in different holders. The plot size is restricted by the area of the bed. Some are as small as A4 size (8&quot;×11&quot; page), while some large beds used in the design of cars, ships, aircrafts, buildings, highways, etc. are up to 20 ft. by 50 ft. Some plotters also etch on plastic or metal plates. In this case, the plastic or metal sheet spreads on the bed and the drawing pen has a sharp-edged needle. </a><a href="part195.htm#bookmark1305" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.35</span> shows a flatbed plotter.</p><p style="padding-left: 167pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="194" height="150" alt="image" src="Image_423.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1304">Figure 6.34. </a><span class="s21">A drum plotter.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 147pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="246" height="115" alt="image" src="Image_424.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1305">Figure 6.35. </a><span class="s21">A flatbed plotter.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Plotters are slow in operation because of excessive mechanical movement required during plotting. Hence, mismatch between CPU speed and plotter speed is large. Hence, in most cases of plotting an output, the CPU first transfers the output onto a tape or disk, and then activates the plotter to plot the output from the tape or disk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part194.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part196.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
