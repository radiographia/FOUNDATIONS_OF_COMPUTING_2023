The first symbol, labeled “<i>Start”</i>, is a terminal symbol indicating the beginning of flowchart logic. It does not mean that someone has to switch on the computer or press a start button. The second symbol is an I/O symbol labeled “Read input data<i>”</i>. This step inputs the roll number, name, and marks obtained by the student from an input device into the main storage of the computer. The third symbol is a processing symbol. Its label indicates that at this step the computer adds the marks obtained by the student in various subjects, and stores the sum in a memory location named <i>Total</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The fourth symbol is again a processing symbol. Its label indicates that at this stage, the program calculates percentage marks by dividing<i>Total </i>by 10, and stores the result in a memory location named <i>Percentage</i>. The fifth symbol is an I/O symbol labeled “Write output data”. This step outputs the roll number, name, and percentage marks obtained on an output device, such as a printer. Note that details such as roll number, name, marks obtained, or percentage being input or output are not part of the logical steps of data input or output operations. Such details are part of the system design document, and are included in the computer program as input and output descriptions. The sixth symbol, labeled “<i>Stop</i>”, is a terminal symbol indicating the end of flowchart logic. Directed flow-lines connect various symbols in the flowchart, indicating the sequence of instructions execution.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1554" class="s23">The logic depicted in </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1554" class="s3">Figure </a>8.4<span class="p">, therefore, will read the student&#39;s record, calculate the percentage marks obtained by him/her, print one line of output, and then stop. Certainly, one would not like to use a computer to solve a trivial problem like this. However, if several students appear for an examination and if we have to compute the percentage marks obtained for each student, we may like to take the help of a computer. The next example illustrates how to do this.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 198pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="110" height="277" alt="image" src="Image_492.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1554">Figure 8.4. </a><span class="s21">Flowchart for Example 8.3.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="49" alt="image" src="Image_493.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Solution:</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1554" class="s23">Since all students appeared for the same examination, the process of calculating and printing percentage marks obtained by each student will be the same. Hence, an easy solution that comes to our mind for this problem is to repeat the intermediate four symbols of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1554" class="s3">Figure </a>8.4<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">fifty times. However, if we do that, 202 (50 x 4 + 2) flowchart symbols will have to be drawn. Obviously, this is a time consuming and tedious job and hence, is not desirable. We will now see how to solve this problem in a simpler way.</span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1555" class="s23">If the program has to repeat the same logical steps more than once, we use flow line symbols in a flowchart to form a process loop (see </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1555" class="s3">Figure </a>8.5<a href="part277.htm#bookmark1555" class="s23">). The flow line pointing upward forms a process loop indicating that after “Write” operation, control flows back to “Read” operation. Hence, the process loop of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1555" class="s3">Figure </a>8.5<span class="s10"> </span><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1555" class="s23">solves the problem of an exceedingly long flowchart by reusing the same logical steps repeatedly. However, the flowchart of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1555" class="s3">Figure </a>8.5<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">is incomplete because the process loop does not have a logical ending. It will continue to attempt to repeat the four steps until someone cancels the job manually. This is an example of an </span><span class="s16">infinite loop</span><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1555" class="s23">. Hence, the flowchart of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1555" class="s3">Figure </a>8.5<span class="s10"> </span><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s23">does not represent an algorithm because an algorithm must terminate. Therefore, we have to find out a way to terminate the algorithm. We do this by using a decision symbol (see the flowchart of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s3">Figure </a>8.6<span class="p">).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 191pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="130" height="258" alt="image" src="Image_494.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1555">Figure 8.5. </a><span class="s21">Flowchart for the solution of Example 8.4 with an infinite (endless) process loop.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s23" name="bookmark1556">The flowchart of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">8.6</span> uses another variable <i>Count</i>. The program logic initializes it to zero outside the process loop and increments it by one, after processing the data for each student. Hence, the value of <i>Count </i>is always equal to the number of students whose data has been processed. The decision step compares the value of <i>Count </i>with 50, the total number of students. The program logic repeats the steps within the process loop until the value of <i>Count </i>becomes 50. When <i>Count </i>becomes 50, the instruction at the decision step causes the control to flow out of the loop, and processing stops because the program logic encounters a terminal symbol labeled <i>Stop</i><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s23">. Hence, the flowchart of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">8.6</span> is a complete and correct solution to the problem of Example 8.4.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s23">However, the flowchart of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s3">Figure </a>8.6<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">suffers from two major drawbacks. The first drawback is that for making the decision at the decision step, one must know the exact number of students who appeared for the examination. If the total number of students appearing for the examination of Example 8.4 is too large (say more than ten thousand), counting the total number of input records (data for each student) becomes a tedious job, and the logic will not work if there is a counting error. If the supplied number is less than the number of input records, the computer will not process the data for last few students. On the other hand, if it is more than the number of input records, the computer will try to read more records than supplied, causing an error in the logic.</span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s23">The second drawback is that the flowchart of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s3">Figure </a>8.6<span class="s10"> </span><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s23">is not a generalized solution to the given problem. If the examination is conducted every year, we will like to use the same program every year. However, the number of students appearing in the examination may not remain the same every year. This year it may be 50, but next year it can be 55, or 60, or anything. Hence, if the computer program to solve this problem is based on the flowchart of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s3">Figure </a>8.6<span class="p">, the statement corresponding to the decision step in that program will have to be changed every time to supply the exact number of students. This is not a good programming practice. A good algorithm (program) should be general in nature. For example, in this case, we should write a program that need not be modified every time even if the total number of students changes.</span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1557" class="s23">The flowchart of </a>Figure 8.6<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">suffers from these drawbacks because it uses the method of counting for controlling the process loop. We can overcome these drawbacks by using another method to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">control the process loop. In this method, a <i>trailer record </i>marks the end of input data<i>. </i>That is, a special record follows the last data record in input, whose sole purpose is to indicate the end of input data. For example, let us assume that the first seven characters of an input record represent a student&#39;s roll number (<i>Rollno</i>). Since 0000000 is never a valid roll number, we can safely use a value of 0000000 as the first seven characters to represent the trailer record. As the program logic processes each input record, it compares the record&#39;s <i>Rollno </i><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1558" class="s23">with 0000000 to determine if processing is complete. </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1558" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">8.7</span> shows the flowchart for the logic of this process. This logic requires a programmer to include instructions in the program to compare the <i>Rollno </i>of each record with 0000000 for determining whether to continue or stop.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The concept of a trailer record uses the idea of selecting a field (a particular item of data) in input record and then selecting a <i>trailer value</i>, also known as <i>sentinel value </i>that never occurs as normal data value for that field. Sentinel value of 0000000 for <i>Rollno </i>field is a good example. When program logic uses a trailer record to mark the end of input data, the decision box for checking the trailer value is usually flowcharted immediately after the input symbol.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 180pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="159" height="458" alt="image" src="Image_495.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1557">Figure 8.6. </a><span class="s21">Flowchart for the solution of Example 8.4.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="206" height="359" alt="image" src="Image_496.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: -91pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1558">Figure 8.7. </a><span class="s21">Generalized flowchart for the solution of Example 8.4 using the concept of trailer record.

It has two decision symbols. The first symbol checks for a trailer record by comparing <i>Rollno </i>with sentinel value of 9999999 to determine whether processing is complete. The second symbol checks whether the student has passed or failed by comparing percentage marks obtained by him/her with 30. If student&#39;s <i>Percentage </i>is equal to or more than 30, he/she has passed, otherwise failed. Note from the flowchart that the program logic performs the operation “Write output data” if the student has passed. If he/she has failed, the program logic performs the operation “Read input data” directly without performing the “Write” operation. Hence, output list will contain details of only those students who passed the examination.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another notable point in this flowchart is the use of <i>Count </i>variable. The program logic initializes it to zero in the beginning and increments it by one every time it performs the operation “Write output data”. However, the program logic performs the operation “Write output data” only for those students who passed. Thus, the program logic increments <i>Count </i>by one only in case of those students who passed. Hence, the value of <i>Count </i>is always equal to the number of students who passed, out of those whose data has been processed. Eventually, when program logic detects the trailer record, the operation “Write Count” prints the final value of <i>Count</i>, which is equal to the total number of students who passed the examination.</p><p style="padding-left: 159pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="214" height="482" alt="image" src="Image_498.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1559">Figure 8.8. </a><span class="s21">Flowchart for the solution of Example 8.5.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="86" alt="image" src="Image_499.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Solution:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1560" class="s23">The flowchart of </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1560" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">8.9</span> is an algorithm for this problem. It has four decision symbols. The first symbol checks for a trailer record by comparing <i>Sexcode </i>with sentinel value Z to determine if processing is complete. The second symbol checks whether the student is female by comparing his/her <i>Sexcode </i>with F. If <i>Sexcode </i>is not F, program logic does not process the data of that student and returns the control to the operation of reading input data. This step ensures that program logic takes the data of only female students for further processing.</p><p style="padding-left: 151pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="238" height="551" alt="image" src="Image_500.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1560">Figure 8.9. </a><span class="s21">Flowchart for the solution of Example 8.6.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The last two decision symbols check whether the student passed in second division. The first one ensures that she scored 45% or more, and the second one ensures that she scored less than 60%. If she scored less than 45%, she has not passed in second division. Hence, without making any further check, program logic returns the control to the operation of reading input data. If she scored 45% or more, program logic makes another check in the fourth decision symbol to ensure that her percentage is less than 60%. If this condition is false, the student scored 60% or more. Hence, she passed in first division (not second division). Therefore, once again, program logic returns the control to the operation of reading input data without writing any output data. If the condition in the fourth decision symbol is true, the candidate passes all checks for being a female student who passed in second division. Hence, only in this case, program logic performs the operation “Write output data”, and increments <i>Count </i>by one.</p><p style="padding-left: 135pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="278" height="634" alt="image" src="Image_501.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1561">Figure 8.10. </a><a href="part277.htm#bookmark1560" class="s42">Flowchart of </a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 10pt;">Figure 8.9</span><span class="s38"> </span><span class="s21">redrawn to illustrate the use of connectors.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Readers should go through the logic of this flowchart repeatedly until they are convinced that output list will contain details of only those female students who passed in second division.

Also, note that a completed flowchart is not a complete computer program. It is only an aid to programming. For a problem, it defines the procedure and the logic for solving the problem.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part276.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part278.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
