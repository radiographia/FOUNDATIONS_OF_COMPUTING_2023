It is a mechanism to deal with the following issues:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. To reduce speed mismatch between slow I/O devices and CPU for better utilization of CPU.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. To convert mutually exclusive (non-sharable) I/O devices into non-mutually exclusive (sharable) I/O devices so that multiple processes of a multiprogramming system can use such a device simultaneously.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We explain here how spooling helps in dealing with these issues.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dealing with Speed Mismatch</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part373.htm#bookmark1954" class="s23">Speed mismatch between a slow I/O device (such as a printer) and CPU is normally of the order of few thousand. Hence, while a slow I/O device is inputting/outputting a few bytes of data to/from main memory, the CPU can perform several thousands of operations. As a result, during reading/writing of data from/to memory, the CPU is idle for a large percentage of I/O time. Spooling reduces the idle time of CPU by placing all data that comes from an input device or goes to an output device on a magnetic disk (see </a><a href="part373.htm#bookmark1954" class="s3">Figure </a>10.30<span class="p">). The primary reason for doing this is to make the program and data available readily to the fast and expensive CPU by keeping it on a high-speed I/O medium (such as a disk). Reading/writing of data from/to a disk is much faster than reading/writing it from/to a slow I/O device, resulting in considerable reduction in CPU idle time during I/O operations involving slow devices.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1953">Most computer systems use special, low-cost I/O processors for spooling input data from a slow input device to a disk, or for outputting spooled output data from a disk to a slow output device. These I/O processors function independent of the main processor (CPU). This enables the main, high-speed, expensive CPU to be devoted fully to main computing jobs. The process of spooling is transparent to user programs. In general, spooling makes better use of both main memory and CPU.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dealing with Mutually Exclusive I/O Devices</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Non-sharable I/O devices, which multiple processes cannot use simultaneously, are called mutually exclusive devices. Printer is an example of such a device. For effective utilization of such devices, an operating system often converts them into non-mutually exclusive virtual devices by using spooling. For this, the operating system creates a special process, called a <i>daemon</i>, and a special directory, called a <i>spooling directory</i>. Now when a process makes a request to use such a device (for example a printer), instead of allocating the printer to the process, the operating system opens a file for the process&#39;s output data in the spooling directory, which it stores on a disk. The operating system writes in this file all output data to the printer by the process. It closes the file when the process completes printing. The daemon then prints the file from the disk to the printer. The daemon is the only process having permission to print the files in the spooling directory on the printer. By protecting the printer against direct use by users, the operating system avoids the problem of having someone keeping it open (engaged) unnecessarily long.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Printer is not the only device that can benefit from spooling in this manner. For example, file transfer over a network often uses a network daemon. To send a file over the network, the operating system puts it in a network spooling directory on the disk. Later on, the network daemon transmits it over the network from the directory.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Note that in both the examples discussed above, spooling allows a dedicated device (such as a printer or a network) to be shared by multiple users simultaneously. This is because spooling being transparent to users, it gives an impression to users that they are inputting/outputting their data from/to the dedicated device directly, not via the daemon process.</p><p style="padding-left: 109pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="347" height="318" alt="image" src="Image_639.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1954">Figure 10.30. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating spooling mechanism.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part372.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part374.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
