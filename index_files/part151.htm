However, the data access speed of a hard disk is much slower than that of a semiconductor RAM (recall that main memory uses RAM chips). This is because hard disks involve mechanical movements, whereas semiconductor RAMs are pure electronic devices. To make applications execute faster, some computer systems use a block of semiconductor RAM chips (other than the RAM chips used for main memory) as a simulated disk. That is, to execute an application, they first load it from hard disk into the simulated disk and then only they start its execution. The application executes faster than normal in this case because the method avoids most of the delay caused otherwise by frequent calls to the hard disk for data loading during execution.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">RAM chips used as a simulated disk are known as <i>RAM disk</i>, <i>silicon disk</i>, or <i>pseudo disk</i>. They either are placed on an add-on circuit board that fits inside the main computer box, or are housed in a separate cabinet. In either case, these extra RAM chips look just like a disk drive to the control programs used in the computer&#39;s operating system. Note that RAM disk is not really a disk at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A RAM disk helps in enhancing the speed of a computer system because its CPU can now access the desired data instantly from RAM disk instead of waiting for few milliseconds to obtain the same data from hard disk. However, RAM chips are volatile and lose data stored in them in case of power off or interruption of power. Thus, a computer system using RAM disk must store programs and data files produced during a processing session on a permanent storage device, such as a hard disk, before power off.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part150.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part152.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
