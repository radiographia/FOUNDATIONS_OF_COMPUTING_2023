Thousands of programmers worldwide continuously enhance its features and back its development and support. It is a multi-tasking, multiprocessing operating system. Originally, its designers had targeted it for personal computers, but today it is popular on all types of systems. The name “Linux” is derived from its inventor Linus Torvalds. Torvalds was a student at the University of Helsinki, Finland in early 1990s when he wrote the first version of an UNIX-like kernel as a toy project. He later posted the code on the Internet and asked programmers across the world to help him build it into a working system. The result was Linux. Torvalds holds the copyright, but permits free distribution of source code. That is, he oversees development of kernel and owns its trademark. When someone submits a change or a feature, Torvalds and his core team of kernel developers review the merit of adding it to kernel source code.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linux Development Process</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Linux being an open-source operating system, various parties participate in its development process. Various participants play the following key roles:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. The open-source development community (programmers across the world) develops the source code for the operating system kernel and submits it to the core team of kernel developers headed by Torvalds. This team reviews the merit of adding a submitted change or feature in the kernel and incorporates it into the kernel, if the team sees merit in doing so. This is how the kernel evolves and matures to become better day-by-day.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Application vendors and programmers download the freely available kernel and develop all types of application software for it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3. Distribution companies package and sell various Linux versions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4. Hardware vendors bundle Linux on their systems and supply their systems along with the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linux operating system and a set of application software.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5. End users run Linux and applications to meet their processing needs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1981">Linux Distribution Versions</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because of its unique development and distribution model, Linux has many commercial flavors. Today there are close to 200 Linux distribution versions. Some of the most popular distribution versions include Caldera OpenLinux eServer, Red Hat, SuSE, TurboLinux Server, Linux- Mandrake, Connectiva, and Red Flag. These versions are available from commercial vendors who make money by selling their implementation, as well as installation, maintenance, and other services. A non-profit Debian organization, which is developing a free operating system and related software, also distributes Linux.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The existence of multiple Linux distribution versions frees users from vendor locking problem. It also creates healthy competition, which furthers innovation. Additionally, the different versions of Linux have always catered to slightly different markets. For example, the SuSE version is for users in banking and telecommunications industries, and the Connectiva version is primarily for South American market.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The main differences among various distribution versions are set of tools and libraries, number and quality of applications, documentation, support, and services.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Linux Distribution and Installation</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Distributors organize Linux as a series of CDs - the <i>A </i>series containing the basic system, the <i>D </i>series containing the compilers and program development tools, the <i>N </i>series containing the modules for networking features, and so on. Users have the flexibility to choose only the series whose features they need. For example, a user does not need the <i>N </i>series, if he/she is not interested in networking features.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A user can install Linux on his/her computer system either as the only operating system or along with other popular operating systems such as MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows. If the user installs multiple operating systems, he/she can boot the machine by choosing the appropriate operating system at the time of booting. For this, the user has to use Linux Loader (LiLo), which is the Linux boot manager. If the user is working with MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows, he/she does not even need to reboot in order to start Linux. He/she can simply use the command LOADLIN to start Linux directly from the MS-DOS command-line interface.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part389.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part391.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
