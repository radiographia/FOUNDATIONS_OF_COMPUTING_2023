Backup policy for a computer system depends on its nature of usage, types of users, its operating environment, etc. A backup policy defines the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. What is the periodicity of backup? Is the backup procedure executed hourly, daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly? Normally, periodicity depends on the nature of usage and criticality of stored data of a system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Whether to take full or incremental backup? This again depends on the nature of usage of the system. For example, if a user creates only a few files (say letters) a day, an incremental backup performed at the end of each day or even once a week may be sufficient. On the other hand, if a user frequently creates many files, weekly full backups are safer. A compromise that works well for many systems is performing incremental backup daily and full backup weekly.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. What storage media to use for backup? Average volume of backup data in each backup cycle normally decides this. We normally take small backup on CD/pen drive, whereas we take larger backup on magnetic tapes, and very large backup on disk packs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Who takes backup? This normally depends on the usage environment of computer systems. For example, a PC user normally takes the backup of his/her PC. In case of large computer centers, where many users share a system, a system administrator normally takes backup of the system. Often backup is an automated procedure in large computer centers. In this case, the system automatically executes backup procedure at defined periodicity for backup of data on hard disk to an on-line backup device such as a tape library. Hence, the system itself takes backup in such systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Where to store the backup media with the backed up data? We just now saw that the backup device along with the media might be an on-line device such as a tape library. In this case, the backup media is stored near to the computer system. This is not acceptable if we need to protect the data against natural calamities. Hence, off-line storage of backup data is always preferred to its on-line storage. Moreover, to protect the data of a computer system against natural calamities, users should store the backup media with the backed up data in a building that is away from the building where the computer system is located.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part175.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part177.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
