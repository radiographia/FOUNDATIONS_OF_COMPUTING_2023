Therefore, from time-to-time, subjects may need to change the set of access rights they have to objects, depending on the task that they have to do at any time. Researchers introduced the concept of domain to provide this type of flexibility of access control in a security system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A <i>domain </i>is an abstract definition of a set of access rights. That is, a set of (object, rights) pairs defines a domain. Each pair specifies an object and one or more operations that a subject operating in that domain can perform on the object. Each one of the allowed operations is called a <i>right.</i></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A domain-based security system defines a set of domains with each domain having its own set of (object, rights) pairs. At any time, each process in the system executes in one of the protection domains, and access rights of a process are equal to the access rights defined in the domain in which it is at that time. A process can also switch from one domain to another during execution.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s46">Figure 15.7</span><span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows an example of a system having three protection domains </span>D<span class="s44">1</span>, D<span class="s44">2</span>, D<span class="s44">3</span>. <span class="p">Note the following points from this example:</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">1. Domains need not be disjoint. The same access rights may exist in two or more domains simultaneously. For instance, access right</span>(Semaphore-1, {Up, Down}) <span class="p">is in both domains </span>D<span class="s44">1</span> <span class="p">and </span>D<span class="s44">2</span>. <span class="p">This implies that a subject in either of the two domains can perform </span>Up <span class="p">and</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Down <span class="p">operations on </span>Semaphore-1.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">2. The same object can exist in multiple domains simultaneously with different rights in each domain. For instance, rights for</span>File-1 <span class="p">and </span>File-2 <span class="p">are different in </span>D<span class="s44">1</span> <span class="p">and </span>D<span class="s44">2</span><span class="p">, and rights for</span>TapeDrive-1 <span class="p">are different in </span>D<span class="s44">2</span> <span class="p">and</span>D<span class="s44">3</span><span class="p">. Considering </span>File-1<span class="p">, a subject in domain</span>D<span class="s44">1</span> <span class="p">can</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Read<span class="p">, </span>Write<span class="p">, and </span>Execute <span class="p">it, but a subject in domain </span>D<span class="s44">2</span> <span class="p">can perform only </span>Read <span class="p">and </span>Write</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">operations on it. Therefore, in order to execute <i>File-1</i>, a subject must be in domain <i>D</i><i>1</i>.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">3. If an object exists in a single domain, only the subjects in that domain can access it. For instance, only the subjects in domain </span>D<span class="s44">3</span> <span class="p">can access </span>File-3.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="547" height="293" alt="image" src="Image_810.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2569">Figure 15.7. </a><span class="s21">A system having three protection domains.</span><a name="bookmark2570">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Since a domain is an abstract concept, its realization, and rules for domain switching are system dependent. For instance, some ways of realizing a domain may be:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Each user as a domain. </b>In this case, the system assigns a process to a domain based on the identity of the user on whose behalf the process is executing. A domain switching occurs when a user logs out and another user logs in.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Each process as a domain. </b>In this case, access rights of a process are limited to the access rights of its own domain. A domain switching occurs when one process sends a message to another process and then waits for a response.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Each procedure as a domain. </b>In this case, each procedure has its own set of access rights and a domain switching occurs when a procedure calls another procedure during the course of its execution.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">UNIX uses both the concepts of user-oriented domains and procedure-oriented domains. Let us first see the use of user-oriented domains. UNIX associates a <i>user-id (uid) </i>and a <i>group-id (gid) </i>with each user. A <i>(uid, gid) </i>pair identifies the list of objects and types of operations that a process can perform on these objects. The domain of a process depends on the user on whose behalf it is executing. Therefore, a process&#39;s <i>(uid, gid) </i>pair defines its domain. That is, two processes with the same <i>(uid, gid) </i>pair will have the same access rights, and two processes with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">different <i>(uid, gid) </i>pairs will have different access rights. In the latter case, several access rights may be the same for the two processes. A process switches domains by acquiring a new <i>uid </i>or <i>gid </i>by executing the<i>setuid </i>or <i>setgid </i>commands. Furthermore, note that <i>superuser </i>in a UNIX system is not a person but a name for a special domain within which the most privileged processes, needing access to all objects in the system, may run.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Now let us see the use of procedure-oriented domains. UNIX groups all procedures in two classes - user procedures and kernel procedures. The two classes form two domains called <i>user mode </i>and <i>kernel mode. </i>A process running in kernel mode has a different set of access rights as compared to a process running in user mode. For example, in kernel mode, a process can access all pages in physical memory, on entire disk area, and all other protected resources. In this two- domain architecture, when a user process does a system call, it switches from user mode to kernel mode. Therefore, at any time, the domain of a process (and hence its access rights) depends on whether it is executing a user procedure or a kernel procedure at that time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part552.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part554.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
