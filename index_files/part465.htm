Therefore, a WAN of multiple LANs is an internetwork.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Internetworks often contain heterogeneous networks that differ in topology and protocol. For example, some LANs of an internetwork may have multi-access bus topology, while others may have ring topology; some of them may be using Ethernet technology, while others may be using Token Ring technology; some segments of the network may be using the IP suite, while others may be using IBM&#39;s SNA (System Network Architecture) protocol suite. Internetworking allows these relatively unrelated networks to evolve into a single working network. That is, the goal of internetworking is to interconnect different physical networks and to hide their details, enabling the internetwork to function as a single coordinated unit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Interconnecting two networks having the same topology and protocol is simple because the two</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">networks can easily communicate with each other. However, interconnecting two dissimilar networks that have different topologies and protocols requires an internetworking scheme that provides some common point of reference for the two networks to communicate with each other. That point of reference might be a high-level protocol common to the two networks, a device that allows interconnection of different topologies with different physical and electrical characteristics, or a protocol that hides operating environment differences from end users. The most commonly used approach is to make use of common high-level protocols for moving data between common layers on a communications model such as the OSI or the IP suites. Internetworking tools, such as bridges, routers, brouters, and gateways, make extensive use of this approach. As described here, each of these tools has strengths, weaknesses, and specific applications in internetworking. These tools are “blackbox” internetworking technologies that enable interconnection of similar or dissimilar networks to form a single network system<b>.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Three commonly used internetworking tools for interconnecting two or more networks to form a single network are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2250">1. </a><b>Bridges. </b>Bridges operate at the bottom two layers of the OSI model (physical and data link). Therefore, network designers use bridges to connect networks, which use the same communication protocols above data-link layer, but may or may not use the same protocols at physical and data-link layers. For example, a bridge can connect two networks, one of which uses fiber-optic communication medium and the other uses coaxial cable; or one of which uses Ethernet technology and the other uses Token Ring technology. However, both networks must use the same high-level protocols (e.g., TCP/IP or XNS) to communicate.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Similarity of higher-level protocols implies that bridges do not modify either the format or the contents of the frames when they transfer them from one network segment to another (they simply copy the frames). Hence, bridges feature high-level protocol transparency. They can transfer data between two network segments over a third segment in the middle that cannot understand the data passing through it. As far as the bridge is concerned, the intermediate segment exists for routing purposes only.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bridges are intelligent devices in the sense that they use a process of learning and filtering in data forwarding to keep network traffic within the segment of the network to which it belongs. Therefore, bridges are also useful in network partitioning. When the performance of a network segment degrades due to excessive network traffic, it can be broken into two network segments with a bridge interconnecting the two segments.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Routers</b>. Routers operate at network layer of the OSI model. Therefore, routers do not care what topologies or access-level protocols the interconnected network segments use. Since routers use the bottom three layers of the OSI model, network designers use routers to interconnect those networks that use the same high-level protocols above network layer. Note that protocols of data-link and physical layers are transparent to routers. Therefore, if two network segments use different protocols at these two layers, network designers must use a bridge to connect them.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unlike bridges, routers do not view an internetwork from end-to-end. That is, bridges know the ultimate destination of a data, but routers know only the next router for a data moving on a network. However, routers are smarter than bridges because they not only copy a data from one network segment to another, but also choose the best route for the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">data by using information in a routing table to make this decision. That is, managing traffic congestion is a big plus of routers; they employ a flow control mechanism to direct traffic on to alternative, less congested paths.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Usually, network designers use routers to interconnect those network segments of large internetworks that use the same communication protocol. They are particularly useful in controlling traffic flow by making intelligent routing decisions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An internetwork often uses both bridges and routers to handle both routing and multiprotocol issues. This requirement has resulted in the design of devices called <i>brouters</i>, which are a kind of hybrid of bridges and routers. They provide many of the advantages of both bridges and routers. They are complex, expensive, and difficult to install, but for very complex heterogeneous internetworks in which the network segments use  the  same  high-level  communication  protocols,  they  often  provide  the  best internetworking solution.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Gateways. </b>Gateways operate at the top three layers of the OSI model (session, presentation, and application). They are the most sophisticated internetworking tools. Network designers use a gateway to interconnect dissimilar networks that use different communication protocols. That is, gateways interconnect networks built on different communications architectures. For instance, a gateway may interconnect two networks, one of which uses the IP suite and the other uses the SNA protocol suite. Since a gateway interconnects networks that use dissimilar protocols, protocol conversion is the major job performed  by  gateways.  Additionally,  gateways  sometimes  also  perform  routing functions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part464.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part466.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
