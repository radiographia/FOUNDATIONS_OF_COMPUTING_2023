Mirroring improves fault tolerance capability because if one copy of the data is corrupted, the other copy is available for accessing. It also improves “read” performance because the system can process two independent read requests simultaneously. Notice that it does not improve “write” performance because the system has to write data to both disks simultaneously. Hence, it cannot process independent write requests simultaneously. The disadvantage of mirroring is that it reduces effective storage capacity of a disk array to half its total capacity, so it is expensive.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Striping. </b>In striping, the system partitions a piece of data into smaller pieces and distributes the pieces across multiple disks. Striping improves both “read” and “write” performance of single tasks, but improvement in “read” performance is less than mirroring when processing multiple tasks. Striping also enables effective storage capacity of a disk array to be equal to its total storage capacity. The disadvantage of striping is that it provides zero fault tolerance. In fact, striping leads to worse availability than just using disks without RAID because a single disk failure causes the entire RAID system to fail. Hence, systems never use striping alone. They use it together with mirroring or parity.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Striping with parity. </b>In striping with parity, the system partitions a piece of data into smaller pieces, distributes the pieces across multiple disks, generates a parity for the data, and stores the parity on one or more disks. With parity data, a system can reconstruct a RAID volume if one disk (sometimes two disks) fails. Parity generation is done either by the RAID controller hardware or by special software at driver level, OS level, or volume manager level. Although parity data uses up some storage space, it uses far less storage than mirroring for supporting fault tolerance. Hence, striping with parity is a cost-effective technique of converting a disk array into reliable large-capacity storage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part157.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part159.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
