Firewalls offer the following advantages:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. They protect an organization&#39;s confidential information from unauthorized outside users by denying them access to data or services inside the organization.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. They prohibit an internal user from accessing unauthorized data or services outside the organization&#39;s network (for example, employees accessing leisure-time sites during office hours).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3. They prevent vulnerable services from entering or leaving the organization&#39;s network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. They protect organization&#39;s computing and networking resources from various kinds of IP spoofing and routing attacks (for example, a host on the Internet pretending to be a host on the organization&#39;s network, or source address of some data falsely making it appear to come from a trustworthy host).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. It provides NATing (Network Address Translating) facility, which maps local addresses of organization&#39;s computers or devices to Internet addresses.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. Two or more properly configured firewalls can implement a <i>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</i>. For example, suppose an organization has two offices connected by an insecure channel (such as public telephone network or the Internet). If the organization uses encryption implemented by the two firewalls (one in each office) for all traffic between them, the encryption effectively implements a VPN between the two offices. It protects the  organization&#39;s  information  flowing  through  the  insecure  channel  against confidentiality and integrity attacks.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. They provide easy implementation and monitoring of security policies of an organization because the organization can implement its security policies at one place. The organization can implement security related audits and alarms on the firewall system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Firewalls, however, are not a cure for all security problems of an organization. They have their own limitations. They cannot protect an organization against the following attacks:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2591">1. Attacks that bypass the firewall. For example, an organization&#39;s LAN may have a pool of modems to provide dial-in capability to traveling employees, or an internal system may have dial-out capability to connect to an ISP. Attacks happening through these links bypass the firewall.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Threats caused by an internal employee who cooperates with an external attacker. For example, firewalls cannot prevent unauthorized leaking of organization&#39;s sensitive data by an employee to someone outside the organization.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. They do not protect against transfer of virus-infected programs or files because a firewall does not scan contents of all incoming files, e-mail, and messages for viruses.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part559.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part561.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
