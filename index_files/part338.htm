We could write the steps required for the calculation of square root each time we need them in the program. However, an easier way of handling the problem would be to write these steps once and then refer to them each time we need them. Every programming language provides a way to do this by defining subprograms. A <i>subprogram </i>is a program written in a manner that a programmer can use it in other programs whenever needed without rewriting.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1791">We refer to a subprogram by different names in different programming languages. For example, other names used for it are </a><i>subroutine</i>, <i>subprocedure</i>, and <i>function</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part338.htm#bookmark1792" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">9.25</span> shows the structure of a subprogram. It consists of a header and a body. The <i>subprogram header</i>, which is the first line of a subprogram, provides a name for the subprogram, and it may optionally specify a list of parameters (also known as arguments). Other programs use the <i>subprogram name </i>to refer to the subprogram when they want to use it. The parameters are specific variable names, numeric values, or other data you want the subprogram to use when it executes the instructions in its body. The list of parameters is optional because there may be subprograms for which you do not need or want to pass any arguments. The <i>subprogram body</i></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">contains the instructions that perform the intended task of the subprogram.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other programs can use a subprogram as often as needed. A programmer has to insert a statement to call the subprogram at whatever points in a program the function performed by the subprogram is required. Typically, a subprogram call statement contains the name of the subprogram followed by a list of parameters enclosed within a pair of parentheses. If you do not need or want to pass any arguments to the subprogram, the empty parentheses are still required normally to distinguish the statement as a subprogram call. For example, a statement to call a subprogram that calculates square root of a number may be <i>a = sqrt (b)</i>. Different programming languages may have different syntax for writing the call statement for calling a subprogram.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="226" alt="image" src="Image_599.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1792">Figure 9.25. </a><span class="s21">The structure of a subprogram.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s46" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part338.htm#bookmark1793" class="s23">When a computer encounters a subprogram call statement while executing a program, the control flow jumps to wherever the subprogram&#39;s code is, executes the statements in the subprogram body, and then returns to the statement immediately after the call statement in the calling program. </a><a href="part338.htm#bookmark1793" class="s3">Figure </a>9.26<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">illustrates the flow of control in case of a subprogram call. Note that the subprogram code appears only once in a program, no matter how often its functionality is required.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Subprograms may be intrinsic or programmer-written.<i>Intrinsic subprograms </i>(commonly referred to as <i>built-in-functions</i>) are those provided with the language so that a programmer need only call them in a program to have them invoked automatically. There are functionalities such as those for finding square root, sine, cosine, logarithm, etc. that are used repeatedly by many programmers in their programs. A programming language usually contains such functionalities in the form of built-in-functions. On the other hand, a programmer writes a <i>programmer-written subprogram </i>and uses it whenever required.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Subprograms can also return a value to the calling program. This makes it convenient to use a subprogram to set the value of a variable. For example, in case of our subprogram to calculate the square root of a number, you supply the number as its parameter, and the subprogram calculates and returns the square root of the number. Based on this criterion, we categorize subprograms into two basic types: procedures and functions. A <i>procedure </i>is a subprogram that performs an action but returns no value. For example, a procedure might print a value or update a data structure. On the other hand, a <i>function </i>is a subprogram that returns a single value, as do mathematical functions like sine, cosine, absolute, square root. General-purpose, high-level</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">programming languages widely use both functions and procedures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="302" alt="image" src="Image_600.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1793">Figure 9.26. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating the flow of control in case of subprogram calls.</span><a name="bookmark1794">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Subprograms have the following advantages:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. They make it easier to write programs because a programmer can call the same code from many places in a program; instead of duplicating it wherever he/she needs it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Since the system keeps only one copy of a subprogram&#39;s code instead of duplicating it wherever a program uses it, source programs and their executable codes are shorter for programs that make use of subprograms. This saves the storage space required for storing such programs, and requires less memory space during their execution.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Subprograms allow programmers to create programs in a modular fashion, which is essential to the construction of large software systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Modular design of software systems in the form of subprograms also provides the capability to compile parts of a program (individual subprograms) without compiling the whole program (all subprograms used by the program) when a programmer changes the program. With this capability, the programmer needs to recompile only those modules (subprograms) of a software system that he/she has changed during its development or maintenance. The linker program then collects and puts together all the newly compiled and previously compiled modules (subprograms) of the software. Without this capability, every change to a software system would require a complete recompilation. In a large system, this is costly.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Creating a subprogram for a task will obviate the need to do it again. This promise gives its author incentive to invest great care in generalizing it, debugging it, optimizing its performance, documenting it, and otherwise perfecting it. Thus, subprograms are generally well written and documented parts of a program.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part337.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part339.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
