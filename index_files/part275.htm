The main advantage of this two-step approach in program writing is that, while drawing a flowchart, a programmer can concentrate on the logic of the solution to the problem at hand, without paying attention to the syntax and other details of the programming language. Moreover, since a flowchart shows the flow of operations in pictorial form, a programmer can detect any error in the logic with greater ease than in the case of a program. Once the flowchart is ready, the programmer can concentrate on coding the operations in each box of the flowchart as statements of the programming language. Normally, this two-step approach ensures an error-free program.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Experienced programmers, sometimes, write programs without drawing a flowchart. However, beginners should first draw a flowchart to reduce the number of errors and omissions in a program. Moreover, it is a good practice to have a flowchart along with a computer program because the flowchart often serves as a document for the computer program. It is useful during the testing of the program, and while incorporating modifications in the program.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part274.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part276.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
