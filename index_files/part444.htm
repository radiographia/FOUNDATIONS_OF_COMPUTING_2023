Hence, for optimal utilization, a channel can be shared among multiple users by simultaneously transmitting multiple signals through it. The method of dividing a physical channel into multiple logical channels to simultaneously transmit a number of independent signals through it is known as <i>multiplexing</i>. The electronic device that performs this task is known as <i>multiplexer</i>.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part444.htm#bookmark2201" class="s23">A multiplexer converts several data communication lines or signals into one data communication line or signal at the sending end. For example, in </a><a href="part444.htm#bookmark2201" class="s3">Figure </a>12.11<span class="p">, the communication system multiplexes signals from four terminals into one large signal, for transmission through one communication line, and breaks the single large signal into four original signals at receiving end. Without  multiplexers,  four  separate  communication  lines  would  be  required.  Hence, multiplexing enables a single transmission medium to transmit data of several transmitters and receivers concurrently.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 169pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="189" height="195" alt="image" src="Image_713.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2201">Figure 12.11. </a><span class="s21">A multiplexed system.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2202">Multiplexing Techniques</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The two basic methods of multiplexing communication channels are frequency-division multiplexing and time-division multiplexing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM). </b><a href="part444.htm#bookmark2203" class="s23">FDM divides the available bandwidth of a physical medium into several smaller, disjoint logical bandwidths, each of which serves as a separate communication line (channel). </a><a href="part444.htm#bookmark2203" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">12.12</span> illustrates the FDM process.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Radio broadcast technology uses FDM to support multiple radio stations simultaneously. It assigns a different frequency range within a bandwidth of radio frequencies to each radio station. Several radio stations transmit speech signals simultaneously over physical channel “ether”, which is an invisible, ever-present, and un-provable medium through which waves travel (propagate) in space. A radio receiver antenna receives signals transmitted by all stations, and a radio set uses a tuning dial to isolate signals of the station tuned. As FDM can deal with only analog signals, a digital communication system using FDM must convert digital signals to analog form.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="470" height="156" alt="image" src="Image_714.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2203">Figure 12.12. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating frequency-division multiplexing.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM). </b><a href="part444.htm#bookmark2204" class="s23">TDM divides the total time available in a channel among several users, and allots a time slice (a short time interval) to each user of the channel, during which he/she may transmit a message. In this way, TDM interleaves multiple data streams of different users into one data stream at sender end of the channel. At receiver end, a demultiplexer reassembles individual chunks of messages into full messages of different users. </a><a href="part444.htm#bookmark2204" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">12.13</span> illustrates the TDM process by multiplexing three different signals.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although TDM can multiplex either digital or analog signals, it is more suitable for digital data transmission. It is also suitable for communication between computers because computers communicate in short fast bursts. Moreover, TDM is efficient because it enables network designers to derive more subchannels.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multiplexing is cost effective when channel cost is high due to long distances. However, a drawback of multiplexing is that if a multiplexed line fails, it affects all users sharing it. Failure of an individual (non-multiplexed) channel is likely to affect one user only.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="152" alt="image" src="Image_715.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2204">Figure 12.13. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating time-division multiplexing.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part443.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part445.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
