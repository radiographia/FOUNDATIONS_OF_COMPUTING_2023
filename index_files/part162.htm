Hence, a Parallel SCSI using a bus of 16 bits width moves 16 bits simultaneously through the bus. The newest type of SCSI, called Serial Attached SCSI (in short, SAS), uses SCSI commands, but transmits data serially (one bit at a time). SAS uses a point-to-point serial connection to transfer data at 3.0 Gigabits/sec. Each SAS port can support up to 128 devices or expanders. With expanders, SAS allows maximum possible connectivity of up to 16,384 devices. SAS is therefore the logical choice, if scalability is a key requirement.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With SAS expanders (which are like high-speed switches) within the enclosures, each device has a dedicated connection to the computer making arbitration unnecessary and resulting in improved performance. SAS dual porting capability and the ability to support I/O requests from more than one controller at a time (multi-initiator) also enables the design of dynamic load balancing systems and redundant path configurations to further increase performance and reliability.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to being software compatible with Parallel SCSI (using same command set), SAS is interoperable with Serial ATA (SATA - described later in this section) as well. As a result, an</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">organization can choose a mix of both SAS and SATA hard disk drives for an optimal mix of high-performance (SCSI-based) and low cost (SATA-based) per GB storage required to meet its unique storage requirements. Compatibility with Parallel SCSI is valuable because it protects an organization&#39;s investments in SCSI. Recall that SCSI technology is more than 30 years old and most servers and many storage applications across the industry use it.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Due to its small form factor (compactness), SAS also addresses the issues of space, heat, and power consumption, which are important in today&#39;s data centers. Its backplane, enclosures, and cabling are less cumbersome, connectors are smaller, and cables are thinner and easier to route. Hence, enterprise users who need more power, easier connectivity, greater scalability, and greater flexibility in building storage solutions also prefer to use SAS.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part161.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part163.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
