Every new generation of language brought significant improvement in programmer productivity by making programming languages more and more user-friendly. Studies indicate that the move from first-generation machine languages to second-generation assembly languages brought approximately a seven-to-one improvement in programmer productivity. The move from second- generation assembly languages to third-generation high-level languages brought much more improvement in programmer productivity. Even after the advent of third-generation high-level languages, researchers continued to make efforts for designing new programming languages, which could further improve programmer productivity. The result of these efforts has been the fourth-generation languages, which claim programmer productivity improvement of 200% to 1000% over third-generation high-level languages.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is a major shift in fourth-generation languages as compared to the languages of previous generations. All previous-generation languages were procedural languages whereas fourth- generation languages are non-procedural. A <i>procedural language </i>(such as C, C++, Java, COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC) is one that requires a programmer to spell out the steps in the processing procedures needed to achieve a desired result. On the other hand, a <i>non-procedural language </i>allows a user to specify “what” the output should be without describing all the details of “how” to manipulate the data to produce that result. With this type of flexibility provided by fourth-generation languages, many computer users often find it easier and quicker to write a program themselves than to depend on professional programmers. Fourth-generation languages are so user-friendly that with a day or two of training and practice, a computer-competent user can learn to write programs, make inquiries, and generate the desired reports on his/her own.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Fourth-generation languages use high-level English-like instructions. They require a programmer to specify only “what” to do, not “how” to do it. The language processor of a 4GL automatically generates most of the procedure portion (steps to carry out a task) of a fourth-generation language  program.  Fourth-generation  language  features  include  limited  mathematical capabilities, automatic report formatting, sequencing, and record selection by criteria. They are primarily used in database programming and scripting. A few examples of fourth-generation</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">languages are SQL, MatLab (MatrixLaboratory), FOCUS, RAMIS, Python, Pearl and Ruby.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part334.htm#bookmark1782" class="s3">Figure </a>9.22<span class="s10"> </span><a href="part334.htm#bookmark1783" class="s23">shows a typical fourth-generation language program, and </a><a href="part334.htm#bookmark1783" class="s3">Figure </a>9.23<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows the result of execution of this program.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1781">Recently, a new generation of programming languages have emerged that have visual tools to develop a program.
