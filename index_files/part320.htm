This means that a company changing its computers, even to one from a different manufacturer, need not rewrite all the programs that it is currently using. This also means that commercial software will have a larger market because it need not be restricted to one type of computer. Hence, developers receive better reward for the time and effort spent on software developed with high-level language programming.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Easier to learn and use. </b>High-level languages are easier to learn because they are similar to the natural languages used by us in our day-to-day life. They are also easier to use because a programmer need not know the internal details of a computer for programming in a high-level language.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Fewer errors. </b>While programming in a high-level language, a programmer need not worry about how and where to store the instructions and data of the program, and need not write machine-level instructions for the computer. This allows the programmer to concentrate more on the logic of the program under development. All these factors lead to fewer programming errors during program development. Furthermore, compilers and interpreters detect and indicate syntax errors automatically. Hence, a programmer can easily locate and correct syntax errors, if any, in a program.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Lower program preparation cost. </b>Writing programs in high-level languages requires less time and effort, leading to lower program preparation cost. Generally, the cost of all phases of program preparation (coding, debugging, testing, etc.) is lower with a high-level language than with a machine/assembly language.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Better documentation. </b>Statements of a program written in a high-level language are similar to natural language statements used by us in our day-to-day life. Hence, a programmer who is familiar with the problem domain can understand them easily. As a result, only few comment statements are required in programs written in high-level languages. Due to this reason, we sometimes refer to high-level languages as <i>self- documenting languages</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1748">6. </a><b>Easier to maintain. </b>Programs written in high-level languages are easier to maintain than assembly/machine language programs. This is because they are easier to understand, and hence, it is easier to locate, correct, and modify instructions whenever desired. We can even insert/remove instructions in/from a program without any complication. Hence, we can incorporate major changes in a program with little effort.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Limitations of High-level Languages</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The two main limitations of high-level languages are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Lower efficiency. </b>Generally, a program written in a high-level language has lower time and space efficiency than one written in a machine/assembly language to do the same job. Hence, when a program&#39;s efficiency is important, we write its performance critical parts in assembly language and non-critical parts in a high-level language. However, with the advent of efficient and optimizing compilers, this problem is now a non-issue.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Less flexibility. </b>Generally, high-level languages are less flexible than assembly languages because they do not normally have instructions or mechanism to directly access a computer&#39;s CPU, memory, and registers. An assembly language provides the programmers access to all the special features of the machine they are using. Certain types of operations that a programmer can easily program by using the machine&#39;s assembly language are impractical to attempt by using a high-level language. This lack of flexibility means that a programmer cannot code some tasks or can code it only with great difficulty in a high- level language.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In most cases, the advantages of high-level languages far outweigh the disadvantages. Hence, software developers use high-level languages for writing most programs, and use assembly languages for doing special tasks only, which they cannot do easily otherwise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part319.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part321.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
