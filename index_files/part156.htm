The unit has one or more CD-ROM drives to read data from CD-ROM disks in the jukebox. In case of units having multiple CD-ROM drives, it is possible to read data from multiple CD-ROM disks simultaneously, resulting in faster data transfer rates. Multiple drives also lead to improved reliability of storage unit because if one of the drives fails, the unit can continue to function with other drives at a slower speed. The unit has robotic arms to retrieve the appropriate CD-ROM and mount it on one of the CD-ROM drives for processing. The robot returns the CD-ROM to the appropriate slot automatically after processing. A large CD-ROM jukebox can accommodate up to several hundred CD-ROM disks, making the storage capacity of the storage unit to several terabytes or several petabytes.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Computer systems use CD-ROM jukeboxes for archiving read-only data that needs on-line access, but where access time is not critical. For example, on-line museums, on-line digital libraries, and on-line encyclopedia are a few systems that often make use of this mass storage device in an effective manner.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We measure average access time of mass storage devices in seconds, instead of milliseconds, because a transport mechanism must first move to retrieve the storage media (such as disk, tape, or CD-ROM) on which the accessed data is stored. It requires several seconds to locate the storage media specified, and then few milliseconds to transfer the data from it to memory. However, a mass storage device has huge storage capacity and a small cost per bit stored.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1160">Relatively slow access time limits the use of mass storage devices in many applications. However, they are cost-effective alternative to on-line magnetic disk storage in applications requiring huge storage capacity and in which rapid access to data is not essential.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part155.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part157.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
