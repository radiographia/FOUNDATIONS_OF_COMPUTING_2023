Few examples of such programs are BE (CS), BE (IT), B.Tech (CS), B.Tech (IT), MCA, MCS, MCM, M.Sc. (IT), BCA, BCS, B.Sc. (IT), DCA, PGDCA, C-DAC&#39;s Pre-DAC and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diploma programs, and DOEACC Certificate Courses.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The primary objective of these education programs is to impart knowledge of the various topics in CS, CA, and IT to their students to meet the industry&#39;s demand for IT professionals. Hence, these programs include various foundation courses in CS, CA, and IT, such as Computer Organization, Programming Fundamentals, Digital Systems Design, Data Structures, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Computer Networks, and Information Security. Since long time, both students and faculty members have wished for a single comprehensive book that can provide a good coverage of the essentials of these foundation courses in a consistent style. <i>Foundations of Computing </i>is designed to meet this requirement of academia.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Industry</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Different IT professionals specialize in different areas. A few such areas are System Analysis and  Design,  Application  Programming,  System  Programming,  Data  Science,  Network Management, and System Administration. A professional working in one such area often needs the understanding of other areas for effective delivery of his/her tasks. For example, a system administrator needs to refer to topics in operating systems, networking, security, and computer architecture to perform his/her job effectively. Similarly, an application programmer needs to refer to topics in software engineering, operating systems, security, networking, database management, and computer architecture to develop good applications. Often, IT professionals refer to the topics in other areas for broadening their knowledge for their professional growth. This requires them to refer to multiple books by different authors. Since long time, they have desired to have a single book that covers all these topics in sufficient depth. They expect the book to serve as a good handbook (reference material) for various topics in CS, CA, and IT to save them from the hassles of purchasing and referring to multiple books. <i>Foundations of Computing </i>is designed to meet this requirement of IT professionals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Entrance Examination Candidates</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To have a bright future in any profession today, one cannot ignore having a sound foundation in IT, because IT is an integral part of all types of professions. Hence, entrance examinations for admissions to several educational institutions/programs and entrance tests for many types of jobs (such as engineering, management, banking, law, administrative services, journalism, etc.) test basic understanding of computing concepts of the candidates. For a long time, candidates preparing for such entrance tests and competitive examinations have desired for a single book that they can use to prepare for various topics in computing. <i>Foundations of Computing </i>is designed to meet this requirement of candidates preparing for various types of entrance examinations and tests.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Usages</h4><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="624" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_013.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although, <i>Foundations of Computing </i>is suitable for a wide range of readers, its four primary usages are as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Textbook</h4><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Foundations of Computing <span class="p">is suitable for use as a textbook for the various foundation courses taught in Master&#39;s, Bachelor&#39;s, Diploma, and Certificate programs in Computer Science (CS), Computer Applications (CA), and Information Technology (IT).
