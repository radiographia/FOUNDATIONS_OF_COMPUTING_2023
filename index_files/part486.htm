Several such groups exist  on  the  Internet  and  are  called  <i>newsgroups</i>. For example,  a newsgroup  named <i>comp.security.misc </i>consists of users having interest in computer security issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A newsgroup is like a large notice board accessible to all members belonging to the group. A member, who wants to exchange his/her views/ideas/information with other members, creates a specially formatted message and submits it to the usenet software running on his/her own computer. The software posts the message on the virtual notice board. Any member belonging to the same newsgroup can read (see) the posted message, just as anyone having access to a notice board can read a notice posted on it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are two types of newsgroups - moderated and non-moderated. In a <i>moderated newsgroup</i>, only selected members have right to post (write) a message directly on a virtual notice board, whereas in a <i>non-moderated newsgroup</i>, any member can post a message on it directly. In a moderated newsgroup, when an ordinary member creates a new message, he/she first sends it to one of the members having the right to post a message on the notice board directly. The authorized member then checks the message to decide its appropriateness for posting. He/she does necessary editing (if any) to improve the message&#39;s quality, and then posts it on the notice board. The message now becomes readable to (can be seen by) other members.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The main idea of a moderated newsgroup is to ensure quality of posted messages. As no one moderates the quality of messages in a non-moderated newsgroup, anyone can post anything. However, members of such newsgroups should be careful in posting a message, because other members may react angrily by sending a flaming message in response to an ill-mannered message. To address this issue, the concept of <i>netiquette </i>(network etiquette) has evolved, which deals with rules of framing messages that will not hurt others.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part485.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part487.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
