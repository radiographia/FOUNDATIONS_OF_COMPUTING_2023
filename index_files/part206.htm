Input-output devices (abbreviated <i>I/O devices</i>) provide the capability to a computer to communicate with its external environment (its users). They are also known as <i>peripheral devices</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. An <i>input device </i>is an electromechanical device that accepts data from outside world and translates them into a form that a computer can interpret.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <i>Keyboard devices </i>are the most commonly used input devices today. They allow data entry into a computer by pressing a set of keys (labeled buttons) mounted on a keyboard.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <i>A graphical user interface </i>(<i>GUI</i>) provides a screen with graphic icons (small images on the screen) or menus and allows a user to make rapid selections from them to give instructions to a computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <i>Point-and-draw devices </i>are input devices used to rapidly point to and select a graphic icon or menu item from multiple options displayed on a screen. Many of these devices are also useful for effectively creating graphic elements on the screen such as lines, curves, and freehand shapes. Some commonly used point-and-draw devices are mouse, trackball, joystick, electronic pen, and touch screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <i>Data scanning devices </i>are input devices that allow data entry directly from the source documents. Some of these devices are also capable of recognizing marks or characters.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. An <i>image scanner </i>is an input device that translates paper documents into an electronic format for input to a computer. Input documents may be typed text, pictures, graphics, or even handwritten material. Image scanners use optical technology to convert an image into electronic form.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. An <i>optical character recognition </i>(<i>OCR</i>) <i>device </i>is a scanner equipped with character recognition software. Users use it for scanning text documents and converting the scanned bitmap images of characters into equivalent ASCII text, which a computer can interpret as letters, numbers, and special characters for word processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. An <i>optical mark reader </i>(<i>OMR</i>) is a scanner that can recognize a pre-specified type of mark made by pencil or pen. We can use OMR device for any input data that is of a choice or selection nature.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">10. <i>Bar codes </i>represent alphanumeric data by a combination of adjacent vertical lines (bars) by varying their width and spacing between them. A <i>bar-code reader </i>is a device for reading (decoding) bar-coded data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. Banking industry uses <i>Magnetic-ink character recognition </i>( <i>MICR</i>) technology for faster processing of large volume of cheques. Besides enabling faster processing of cheques, this technology also ensures greater accuracy of data entry because of mostly pre-printed information on the cheque and direct feeding of the cheques to the computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">12. A <i>digitizer </i>is an input device used for converting (digitizing) pictures, maps, and drawings</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">into digital form for input to computers. This enables re-creation of the drawing from the stored information and easy incorporation of changes in the drawing, whenever required.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">13. <i>Electronic cards </i>are small plastic cards having encoded data appropriate for the application for which they are used. An <i>electronic-card reader</i>, normally connected to a computer, reads the data encoded on an electronic card and transfers it to the computer for further processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">14. Depending on the manner in which they encode data, electronic cards are of two types: magnetic strip cards and smart cards. <i>Magnetic strip cards </i>store encoded data on a magnetic strip attached to the card, while <i>smart cards </i>have a built-in microprocessor chip in whose memory the encoded data is stored.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">15. <i>Speech recognition devices </i>are input devices that allow a user to input data to a computer system by speaking to it. They are of two types: speaker-dependent and speaker- independent. Speaker-dependent systems recognize the speech of only a single individual or a few individuals, while speaker-independent systems can recognize words spoken by anyone.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">16. A <i>vision-input system </i>consists of a digital camera to accept input by seeing an object. Input data in this case is normally an object&#39;s shape and features in the form of an image.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">17. An <i>output device </i>is an electromechanical device that accepts data from a computer and translates them into a form that is suitable for use by outside world (users).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">18. Computer output generated by output devices are of two types - soft-copy output and hard-copy output. <i>Soft-copy output </i>is temporary in nature because it does not appear on a paper or some material that a user can carry for showing to others, or for filing and use later when he/she is not using a computer. <i>Hard-copy output </i>is permanent in nature because it appears on a paper or some material that a user can carry for showing to others, or for filing and use later when he/she is not using a computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">19. <i>Monitors </i>generate soft-copy output by displaying an output on a screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">20. A monitor and a keyboard together form a <i>video display terminal </i>(<i>VDT</i>) often referred to as just <i>terminal</i>. A terminal serves as both an input and output device. It is the most popular input/output (I/O) device used today.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">21. Depending on their local processing capability, we classify terminals as dumb, smart, and intelligent. A <i>dumb terminal </i>is a low-cost terminal, without any local processing capability. A <i>smart terminal </i>has local data editing capability and the ability to consolidate input data prior to sending it to the computer. It has a microprocessor and some internal storage in addition to I/O capabilities. An <i>intelligent terminal </i>is a small computer by itself that has extensive local data processing capability. It consists of a built-in microcomputer and users can program it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">22. A <i>terminal emulator </i>is a software program that runs on a PC or workstation, communicates with the network interface over a serial port on the PC or workstation, and pretends that it is a terminal.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">23. Monitors often use <i>privacy filters </i>to prevent others sitting/standing nearby from viewing the contents displayed on it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">24. <i>Printers </i>are the most popular hard-copy output devices used today. Based on the printing technology used, we classify printers as dot-matrix printers, inkjet printers, drum printers,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">chain/band printers, and laser printers. According to printing approach that a printer uses, we classify printers as impact printers and non-impact printers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">25. <i>Dot-matrix printers </i>are character printers that form characters and images as patterns of dots.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">26. <i>Inkjet printers </i>are character printers that form characters and images by spraying small drops of ink on paper.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">27. <i>Drum printers </i>are line printers that print characters by striking a set of hammers on an inked ribbon and paper placed against a solid cylindrical drum with characters embossed on its surface in the form of circular bands.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">28. <i>Chain</i>/<i>band printers </i>are line printers that print characters by striking a set of hammers on an inked ribbon and paper placed against a metallic chain/band on which all characters of the character set supported by the printer are embossed.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">29. <i>Laser printers </i>are page printers that produce high quality output by forming characters and images with tiny ink particles.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">30. <i>Hydra printers </i>are multifunctional devices that perform the functions of two or more of the following office equipment - printer, copy machine, and scanner.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">31. A <i>plotter </i>is an ideal output device for architects, engineers, city planners, and others who need to generate high precision, hard-copy graphic output of varying sizes. Two types of plotters in common use are drum plotter and flatbed plotter.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">32. 3D printers print (create) 3D objects by using additive manufacturing techniques.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">33. Some commonly used 3D printing technologies include Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), STereoLithography (STL), Digital Light Processing (DLP), and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">34. <i>Computer Output Microfilm </i>(<i>COM</i>) is an output device that records computer output as microscopic filmed images on a sheet of microfilm. It uses a <i>microfilm recorder </i>for recording output on a microfiche, and a <i>microfilm reader </i>to view recorded information.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">35. <i>Screen image projector </i>is an output device, which is used to project information from a computer on a large screen (such as a cloth screen or wall) so that a group of people can view it simultaneously.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">36. A <i>voice response system </i>enables a computer to talk to a user. Two types of voice response systems are - voice reproduction system and speech synthesizer. A <i>voice reproduction system </i>produces audio output by selecting an audio output from a set of pre-recorded audio responses, while a <i>speech synthesizer </i>converts text information into spoken sentences.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">37. <i>Ergonomically designed I/O devices </i>aim at achieving maximum efficiency of the people working on them and protecting them from accidents or medical problems caused due to continuous usage of a device for long hours.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">38. <i>I/O interfaces </i>deal with how I/O devices connect to and communicate with a computer system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">39. A <i>device controller </i>is an interface unit between an I/O device and a computer&#39;s system bus. On one side, it communicates with the I/O device connected to it, and on the other side, it communicates with the computer&#39;s CPU and memory through the system bus.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">40. I/O devices connect to I/O ports of a device controller, which in turn connects to a computer&#39;s system bus. I/O devices plug into <i>I/O ports </i>of a computer system. I/O ports are of two types - serial ports and parallel ports.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">41. A user can use a <i>serial port </i>of a computer to connect any device that sends or receives a stream of bytes serially, one bit at a time. Users normally use it for connecting slow I/O devices such as terminal, keyboard, mouse, modem, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">42. A <i>parallel port </i>can handle higher volume of data than a serial port because it transfers 8 or 16 bits of data at a time. Users normally use it for connecting faster I/O devices such as printer, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">43. <i>SCSI interface </i>uses a generic device controller (called SCSI controller) and enables connection of any device (having SCSI interface) with the SCSI bus of the SCSI controller. This helps save expansion slots in a computer for connecting other devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">44. We often use <i>USB (Universal Serial Bus) </i>standard to connect I/O devices to a computer. It is a serial bus, which supports four speeds - a super-speed mode of 5 Gbits/sec, a high- speed mode of 480 Mbits/sec, a full-speed mode of 12 Mbits/sec, and a low-speed mode of 1.5 Mbits/sec.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part205.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part207.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
