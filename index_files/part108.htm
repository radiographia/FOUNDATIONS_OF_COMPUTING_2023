However, one thing it does not have built into it is the place to store programs and data needed during data processing. We also saw that the CPU contains several registers for storing data and instructions, but they can store only a few bytes at a time. They are just sufficient to hold one or two instructions with corresponding data. If instructions and data of an executing program were to reside in secondary storage like a disk, and fetched and loaded one-by-one into CPU registers as the program execution proceeded, this would lead to the CPU being idle most of the time. This is because there is a large speed mismatch between the rate at which CPU can process data and the rate at which the system can transfer data from disk to CPU registers. For example, a CPU can process data at a rate of about 5 nanoseconds/byte and a disk reader can read data at a speed of about 5 microseconds/byte. Hence, within the time in which a disk can supply one byte of data, a CPU can process 1000 bytes. This would lead to poor overall performance even for a computer having a fast CPU. To overcome this problem, there is a need to have a reasonably large storage space that can hold instructions and data of the program(s) on which the CPU is currently working. The time to fetch and load data from this storage space into CPU registers must also be considerably less as compared to that from disk storage to reduce the speed mismatch problem with CPU speed. Every computer has such a storage space known as <i>primary storage</i>, <i>main memory</i>, or simply <i>memory</i>. Instructions and data of a program reside mainly in this area when CPU is executing the program. Physically, this memory consists of some integrated circuit (IC) chips either on the motherboard or on a small circuit board attached to the motherboard of a computer system. This built-in memory allows CPU to store and retrieve data quickly. The rate of fetching data from this memory is of the order of 50 nanoseconds/byte. Hence, the rate of data fetching from main memory is about 100 times faster than that from a high-speed secondary storage like disk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part109.htm">Storage Evaluation Criteria</a><a class="toc0" href="part110.htm">Main Memory Organization</a><a class="toc0" href="part111.htm">Main Memory Capacity</a><a class="toc0" href="part112.htm">Types of Memory Chips</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part107.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part109.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
