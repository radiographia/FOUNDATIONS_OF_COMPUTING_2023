If the computer has color display, the usual default is</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2323">for links to be in both blue and red colors. Blue links are places, which the user has not visited yet in his/her current Internet surfing session, and red links are places, which the user has already visited. In other words, once the user clicks on a link and goes to that place, if during the same navigation session the user ever comes back to the same text, it will show up as a red link indicating that the user has already visited the place of this link. This little navigation helper is a great time-saver, if the user jumps from server-to-server searching for information on some topic.</a></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part489.htm#bookmark2324" class="s3">Figure </a>13.1<span class="p">(a) shows the functional structure of a graphical browser.

That is, every possible type of data, protocol, and behavior that a browser can deal with is frozen into its design at the time of building the browser. This means that every time a new data type, protocol, or behavior is invented, this browser must be upgraded to make it capable of dealing with the new situation. From the viewpoint of end users, this is a difficult job because users must continually be aware of what data types and protocols exist, which browsers deal with which of these data types and protocols, and which versions of which browsers are compatible with each other. Given the rapid growth of the Internet, this situation is clearly out of control.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="506" height="610" alt="image" src="Image_748.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2324">Figure 13.1. </a><span class="s21">Functional structure of a conventional graphical browser and a Java-enabled browser.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Java-enabled browsers overcome the above-mentioned limitations of conventional graphical browsers. They are based on the Java programming language and have the ability to dynamically download Java applets (mini-applications) from web-server computers to web-client computers and execute them on client&#39;s computer. This feature provides the following capabilities to Java- enabled browsers:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Dynamic content. </b>We saw that a first-generation browser can download data from a server computer to its own client computer and can display the data on the client&#39;s computer terminal screen. In addition to data, Java-enabled browsers can also download Java-based <i>applets </i>(segments of programs that act as mini-applications) on the client computer for execution there. When the client computer executes a Java-based applet, the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2325">applet may provide full animation, play sound, or interact with the user in real time. Thus, Java-enabled browsers transform the static data display capability of first-generation browsers into a new and dynamic viewing system. They enable creation and display of animation-oriented applications that was not possible with first-generation browsers. For example, someone could write a Java program to implement an interactive chemistry simulation. Users browsing the Internet with a Java-enabled browser could download this simulation program on their computer and interact with it, rather than just having a static picture with some text displayed on their computer screen.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Dynamic data types. </b><a href="part489.htm#bookmark2324" class="s23">We saw that due to their monolithic design structure, the first- generation browsers could deal with only a fixed set of data objects. For example, a browser might understand only the following image formats - GIF, X11 pixmap, and X11 bitmap. If this browser sees a new image format, it cannot display it because it does not know how to deal with it. A Java-enabled browser overcomes this problem because while downloading an unknown data type object, it can also download from the server computer the Java-based applet for dealing with the unknown data type object The client computer then executes the applet to deal with the unknown data type object and to display it on screen. </a><a href="part489.htm#bookmark2324" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">13.1</span>(b) illustrates how a Java-enabled browser interacts with a server when it encounters an object of an unknown type.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Notice that the capability of Java-enabled browsers to dynamically understand different types of objects makes life of the Internet users much more comfortable. For example, an inventor of a new object type has to only ensure that a copy of the Java-based applet for dealing with the object type is installed on the server that contains the object type, instead of upgrading all browsers in the world. A Java-enabled browser upgrades itself dynamically when it encounters a new type of object.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Dynamic protocols. </b>HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol) is the most commonly used protocol, which computers on the Internet use to interact. Hence, most first-generation browsers have knowledge of HTTP built in them. However, with the increase in commercial use of the Internet, many software vendors are providing new browsers and servers with added capabilities, such as billing and security. These new capabilities most often take the form of new protocols. Therefore, each vendor comes up with a unique style of security and sells a server and browser that understand this new protocol. An increasing trend of such new protocols have become a problem for Internet users because if a user wants to access data on multiple servers with each one having its own proprietary new protocols, the user needs multiple browsers or needs to upgrade its browser every time a new protocol is introduced. This is certainly not possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A Java-enabled browser overcomes this problem of dealing with new protocols because it can dynamically download the Java-based applet for dealing with the new protocol from the server computer with which it is interacting. The software vendor of a server with a new protocol just has to install on the server a copy of the Java-based applet for dealing with the new protocol. A Java-enabled browser dynamically upgrades its capability of understanding new protocols as and when it encounters a new protocol.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are many Java-enabled browsers available today such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox, and Apple Safari.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part488.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part490.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
