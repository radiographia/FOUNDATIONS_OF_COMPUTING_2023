For example, we use “run” or “exec” statement to execute a program and “copy” statement to copy a file from one storage device to another. Often we also need to execute a set of commands to perform a task. For example, to perform a task, a user may be required to execute two independent programs, and after execution of the first program, he/she may be required to copy the output file of the first program on to a device from which the second program expects the input. Therefore, in this case, the user needs to specify two execute commands for executing the two programs and a copy command before the second execute command. A <i>scripting language </i>is a programming language that allows a programmer to integrate several such commands into a single command so that the programmer need not type all the commands every time he/she needs to perform the intended task. We refer to a program written in a scripting language as a <i>script</i>. Scripting languages support variables and simple control structures to allow programmers to write scripts, which can execute conditionally or repeat the execution of certain commands. With these features, scripting languages are useful for defining complex commands execution patterns.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another common use of scripting languages is in specifying execution environment setup for applications that are quite complex, yet flexible enough for use in a variety of contexts. For an individual run of such an application, programmers must configure a setup to customize the application for its current run. A programmer can write a script in a scripting language to specify this setup. The script integrates individual commands into a single command that the programmer can use to drive application execution.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A scripting language is interpreted, rather than compiled. Hence, a script can interact with a running program and change during the run. In addition to controlling a running program, scripts can preprocess and postprocess data.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Scripting languages typically let programmers invoke individual application components. Application components are individual programs (such as data format converters and visualizers) that carry out specific data processing tasks and are usable in different contexts.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: justify;"><a href="part333.htm#bookmark1779" class="s23">Some commonly known scripting languages are Unix Shell Script, Perl, Tcl, and Python.

The first line of the script sets the variable ‘ users’ equal to the value produced by the pipeline of commands ‘who I wc -l’. This is in fact a count of the number of users currently logged on to the system. This value is then compared with the number 10, and if it is greater, then the message is displayed.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part332.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part334.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
