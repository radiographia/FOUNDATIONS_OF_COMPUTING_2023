It is a single-user operating system for IBM and IBM-compatible personal computers. Microsoft and IBM introduced it jointly in 1981. It was the most popular operating system for personal computers in the 1980s. Because of its popularity, Microsoft later took a decision to independently launch Microsoft Windows operating system in 1990s.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structure of MS-DOS</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">MS-DOS has the following three layers:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>BIOS. </b>BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System. It contains device drivers for standard devices such as keyboard, disk, printer, and display monitor. It also contains basic low- level services such as time-of-day and system configuration analysis. With hardware- dependent services in BIOS, the operating system ensures that it can offer other higher- level operating system services in a hardware-independent manner. This enables those operating system services to be portable to other machines.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Usually, computer manufacturers (not Microsoft) supply the BIOS. Generally, the BIOS is located, in part, in a ROM, which is a non-erasable memory. When a user switches on a computer, the computer&#39;s hardware transfers control to the bootstrap procedure of the BIOS in ROM. The bootstrap procedure carries out some hardware tests to check whether the memory and other hardware devices are functioning properly. If the hardware tests pass successfully, the bootstrap procedure loads into memory a small portion of the operating system from disk. This part of the operating system then loads the rest of the memory resident portions of the operating system into memory from disk. This step-by- step process of loading the operating system into memory is known as <i>booting the system</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Kernel. </b>This layer contains all the modules for process management, memory management, and file management. These modules usually are machine-independent, enabling their easy portability to other machines.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Shell. </b>This layer has the command interpreter. MS-DOS provides a command-line interface. MS-DOS shell, known as <i>command.com</i>, has about 70 commands, which are partitioned into two categories - internal commands and external commands. <i>Internal</i></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">commands <span class="p">are those, which are always memory resident, whereas </span>external commands <span class="p">are those, which normally reside on disk. The operating system loads an external command into memory whenever a user executes it. Due this, the operating system takes more time to execute an external command than an internal command. Later, the designers added a GUI (known as </span>DOS shell<span class="p">) to this layer, which was largely a menu-driven user interface.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part387.htm#bookmark1976" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">10.31</span> lists some of the shell commands to give an idea of what the shell commands look like and what they do. The figure lists both MS-DOS and Unix versions. Normally, a command&#39;s name signifies its task so that users can remember and use the commands easily. Moreover, note that the commands are usually short so that users have to type a few characters only to invoke a task. Most of these commands require arguments. For example, <i>del </i>command requires the name of the file, which the user wants to delete.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Limitations of MS-DOS</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In-spite-of its wide popularity in the 1980s, MS-DOS could not continue to be popular like Unix for a long period. Operating systems researchers often quote the following reasons for its failure:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. It was a single user, single task operating system (did not support multitasking). That is, it assumed that only one user uses a computer and runs only one program at a time.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1975">2. Since it was a single user, single task operating system, it did not have any protection features to protect two or more programs from one another, which are in memory.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. It had limited program addressability to 640 Kbytes. Hence, it could execute only those programs whose maximum size was 640 Kbytes. At first, this was not a problem, since in those days computers had only 64 Kbytes of RAM. However, when later models came out with up to 16 megabytes of RAM, the inability to run programs larger than 640 Kbytes became a major limitation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. It supported only 16-bit CPUs that Intel was making in the early and middle 1980s. It could not take advantage of 32-bit CPUs, which Intel made later.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. It restricted users to eight-character file names with three-character extensions. Due to the lack of flexibility of using long file names, users often found it inconvenient to choose appropriate file names. No major operating system places this restriction on its users.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. It had a command-line interface, which some users found difficult to use and hard to learn.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="463" height="242" alt="image" src="Image_645.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1976">Figure 10.31. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating some of the shell commands.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part386.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part388.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
