Today, several other products use FireWire interface, including consumer products such as cameras, scanners, printers, televisions, game consoles, and many kinds of storage devices. Apple&#39;s iPod MP3</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">player uses FireWire as its only data and power connection.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FireWire is a high performance serial bus that can support packet transfer at 100, 200, 400, and 800 Megabits/sec simultaneously. A single bus can freely mix up to 63 devices supporting any or all of these speeds. The bus transports each packet at the best possible speed depending on the source and destination nodes. Hence, adding a digital video camera capable of only a 100 Megabits/sec rate need not force computers and storage devices to slow down from a 800 Megabits/sec rate they commonly support. Like a bus, it makes all packets visible to all nodes, with the exception that it cannot send higher-speed packets to or through lower-speed devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FireWire uses isochronous transport to provide real-time data delivery, reserving up to 80% of the bus bandwidth for one or more isochronous channels. The hardware then provides guaranteed transmit opportunities at defined intervals to ensure timely data transfer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FireWire uses Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) specification, which can service read and write requests by Direct Memory Access (DMA) to the specified memory address, without assistance from the local CPU or any interrupts. With this architecture, each storage device added to a FireWire bus acts as an additional DMA controller and can move data to or from host memory at its own pace.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FireWire devices can be connected or disconnected from the bus at any time. Self-describing and self-configuring, these devices free users from having to adjust ID selectors or assign drivers to devices individually. FireWire provides an easy and quick way to add, upgrade, and share computer storage devices. High-performance RAID applications have also adopted FireWire.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FireWire is particularly useful for connecting multiple devices. Using peer-to-peer access, the devices can interoperate as peers to deliver greater capability as a system than each device can offer alone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part164.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part166.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
