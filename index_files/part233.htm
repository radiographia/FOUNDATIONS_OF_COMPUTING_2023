Unit testing verifies if a module meets its specifications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When the team integrates the independently developed and tested modules into a complete system, the team then tests the integrated system to check, if all modules coordinate properly with each other and the system as a whole behaves as per the specifications. This is known as <i>integrated testing</i>. The software is ready for release after completion of integrated testing.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Alpha and Beta Testing</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After completion of integrated testing, the team releases the software for further testing to a select user group within or outside the organization. This group tests the software by using it as if they are its users. This release version of the software is known as<i>alpha version </i>and the test conducted on it is called <i>alpha testing</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If the software is to be sold commercially, instead of releasing it directly in the commercial market after alpha testing, the team sometimes releases it for additional testing to a selected set of users such as long time customers, partner agencies, and at times put for download and trial by anyone. This release version of the software is known as <i>beta version</i>. The selected set of users use the beta version of the software for an identified period and report any bug found in the software to the company developing the software. The use of beta version of the software by the selected set of users for additional testing is known as <i>beta testing</i>. After beta testing, the team fixes the reported bugs (if any), and then the company releases the software to the commercial market. Even at this stage the software may contain certain errors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Functional and Non-Functional Testing</h4><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Functional testing <span class="p">verifies whether the software functions as expected with all types of possible valid input data and meets all the design requirements. This ensures that the software operates correctly for all types of input data falling within its design requirements and scope.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Functional testing is necessary, but insufficient to guard against certain risks. It does not test the error handling capability of software (how the software behaves in case of abnormal or unusual input data). Good software must produce appropriate error messages for invalid data instead of hanging (not continuing with its execution), or generating meaningless output. <i>Non-functional testing </i>verifies whether the software behaves properly even when it receives invalid or unexpected inputs (such as incorrect, incomplete, or inappropriate data). Non-functional testing tests non-functional aspects of software such as:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">1. <i>Scalability testing</i>, which tests if the software can handle large quantities of data or large number of users.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. <i>Usability testing</i>, which tests if the software is easy to learn and use.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">3. <i>Security testing</i>, which tests if the software can protect use of confidential data by unauthorized users.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. <i>Internationalization testing</i>, which tests if users from other countries can use the software.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">5. <i>Localization testing</i>, which tests if the software takes care of country-specific parameters (currency, formats, look-and-feel, etc.).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1445">Black-box, White-box, and Grey-box Testing</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In <i>black-box testing</i>, the tester treats the software as a black box because he/she has no knowledge of its internal data structures, algorithms, or the code of the software. The tester designs test cases based on the system specifications and planned usage to test the functionality according to the requirements. The tester inputs data for a test case and verifies if the output is the same as the expected value specified in the test case (the system behaves as expected).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Black-box testing has the advantage of an unbiased opinion because the tester is not part of the design or implementation team. Hence, the tester can find those bugs, which the design or implementation team cannot think of. On the other hand, black-box testing has the disadvantage of blind exploration because the tester has no idea of the internal construction details of the system. Due to this, it is possible that the tester writes many test cases to test something, which a white-box tester can test by only one or two test cases. It is also possible that the test cases written by a black-box tester do not test some parts of the system at all. Hence, testing teams use black-box testing primarily for specification-based testing and usage-based testing. These two types of testing are described later.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In <i>white-box testing</i>, the tester has good knowledge of the internal data structures, algorithms, and the code of the software. He/she designs test cases based on the knowledge of internal construction details of the system. This allows the testing team to ensure that all parts (function points) of the system are tested. For example, testing team can generate test cases to cause all statements in a program to be executed at least once (this is known as <i>code-coverage </i>testing). Testing teams use white-box testing primarily for code-based testing and fault-based testing. These two types of testing are described later.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In <i>grey-box testing</i>, the testing team designs test cases based on requirement specification as well as internal data structures, algorithms, and code of the software. Hence, grey-box testing ensures that the testing team generates test cases to test the system in optimal time. It also includes testing of non-functional aspects of the system. Once the members responsible for generation of test cases have completed their job, they hand over the test cases to a different set of members, who carry out black-box type testing of the system with the received test cases. They generate a set of input data for each test case and compare the system&#39;s output for each input with the expected output.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part232.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part234.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
