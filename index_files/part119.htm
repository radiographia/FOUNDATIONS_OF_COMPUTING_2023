Hence, computer systems also use buses for interconnecting the CPU with I/O devices. A system uses the same three types of buses used for interconnecting CPU and memory for interconnecting CPU with I/O devices. Their roles in context of I/O devices are described</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">here.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Data bus. </b>A system uses data bus to transfer data between the CPU and I/O devices. A wider data bus enables faster exchange of data between the CPU and I/O devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A system normally uses industry standard data buses to connect cards of peripheral I/O devices to the system&#39;s motherboard. Some industry standard data buses that older computer systems used are ISA (Industry Standard Architecture), MCA (Micro Channel Architecture), EISA (Extended Industry Standard Architecture), and AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port). Industry standard data buses used in modern computer systems are:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. <i>PCI (Peripheral Component Interface). </i>PCI bus has a fixed width of 32 bits with maximum signaling frequency of 33.33 MHz. Hence, its peak data transfer rate is 133 MB/sec (133 Mega (million) Bytes per second) (33.33 MHz x 32 bits ÷ 8 bits/byte = 133 MB/sec). For years, PCI has been a versatile, functional way to connect sound, video, and network cards to a motherboard.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. <i>PCI-X (PCI Extended). </i>PCI-X doubles the bus width to 64 bits and increases the maximum signaling frequency to 133 MHz. Hence, its peak data transfer rate is 1014 MB/sec. A newer version of PCI-X further increases the maximum signaling frequency to 266 MHz. Hence, its peak data transfer rate is 2035 MB/sec. All PCI- X versions are backward compatible with PCI.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">c. <i>PCIe (PCI Express). </i>PCI and PCI-X are bus-based standards in which all devices connected to the 32-bit or 64-bit bus share the same bidirectional, parallel signal path. This requires “arbitrating” the bus or waiting for the bus to be free. Unlike PCI and PCI-X, PCIe is a point-to-point bus. It is built around pairs of serial (1-bit), unidirectional point-to-point connections called <i>lanes</i>. Hence, PCIe is a serial connection that operates more like a network than a bus. Instead of one bus that handles data of multiple devices connected to it, PCIe has a switch that controls several point-to-point serial connections. In this manner, each device gets its own dedicated connection, so devices no longer share bandwidth as they do on a normal bus.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Each PCIe slot has 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 lanes between the motherboard and the card. It is customary to write number of lanes with an ‘x’ prefix. For example, x1, x2, x3,</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">…,  x32  refer  to  one-lane,  two-lane,  three-lane,  …,  thirty-two-lane  cards respectively. Each lane contains two pairs of wires, one for sending, and one for receiving. Packets of data move across a lane at a rate of one bit per cycle. Therefore, an x1 link has one lane made up of four wires and transmits one bit per cycle in each direction. An x2 link has two lanes made up of eight wires and transmits two bits at once, an x4 link transmits four bits at once, and so on. The latest available version of PCI-Express is PCTe 5.0. The bandwidth for each PCIe</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">5.0 lane is 4 GB/sec. Hence, a PCI-Express 5.0 x16 device will have up to 64 GB/sec bandwidth.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PCIe slots come in different physical sizes referred to by the maximum number of lanes they support. A PCIe card fits into a slot of its size or bigger, but not into a smaller PCIe slot.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PCI, PCI-x, and PCIe are all compatible. Because PCIe has faster data transfer rate</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">than PCI and PCI-X, and it is compatible with them, it is likely that PCIe will eventually replace PCI and PCI-X.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">d. <i>HT (HyperTransport). </i>HT is a packet-based point-to-point bus. It has at least two unidirectional links. Each link can be of 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 bits width with maximum signaling frequency of 800 MHz. Hence, peak data transfer rate for a pair of 8 bits links is 1.6 GB/sec (800 MHz x 2 x 8 bits ÷ 8 bits/byte = 1.6 GB/sec). This gives aggregate bandwidth of 3.2 GB/sec in both directions for a pair of 8 bits links. A system can double or quadruple aggregate bandwidth by using 16 bits or 32 bits links respectively. Currently, some systems use HT bus in conjunction with AMD processors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Address bus. </b>Normally, a computer system has multiple I/O devices like disk, tape, network, etc. simultaneously connected to it. Each I/O device has a unique identifier (or address) associated with it. The system uses address bus to carry the address of the I/O device, which the CPU needs to access.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Control bus. </b>A system uses control bus to carry commands such as <i>START</i>, <i>READ</i>, <i>WRITE</i>, <i>REWIND TAPE</i>, etc., from CPU to I/O devices. It also carries status information of I/O devices to CPU.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part119.htm#bookmark1001" class="s23">Thus, an I/O device access by CPU involves all three buses - control bus carries device access command, address bus carries device address, and data bus carries the data. </a><a href="part119.htm#bookmark1001" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">4.10</span> shows the three buses used for interconnecting the CPU and I/O devices for enabling this. Each device has a <i>controller, </i>which controls the operation of the device. It also temporarily stores the data transferred between the CPU and the device in a local data register.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="269" height="104" alt="image" src="Image_319.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1001">Figure 4.10. </a><span class="s21">Three different types of buses used between the CPU and I/O devices.</span><a name="bookmark1002">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part118.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part120.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
