However, in real life, we often come across situations in which it is not only sufficient to obtain correct results, but it is also important to obtain the results within some specified period (deadline) for the results to be useful.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A few examples of such applications are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. An aircraft must process accelerometer data within a certain period (say every 20 milliseconds) that depends on the specifications of the aircraft. Failure to do so could cause the aircraft to go away from its right course, or may even cause it to crash. Failure to respond in time to an error condition in a nuclear reactor thermal power plant could result in a melt down.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Failure to respond in time to an error condition in the assembly line of an automated factory could result in several faulty product units, which the quality control department will discard ultimately.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. A computerized railway reservation system must process a passenger&#39;s request for booking a ticket within the passenger&#39;s perception of a reasonable time (say 3 minutes).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Such applications require a special type of system, called real-time system, for their processing. That is, a <i>real-time system </i>is a system that satisfies the requirement of producing the desired results before a specified deadline. If it delivers the correct result for a user, but after the deadline, the user considers the system to have failed. Hence, timely production of the result of processing is as important as its correctness in a real-time system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Real-time systems use a special type of operating system called <i>real-time operating system</i>. The goals of CPU scheduling in traditional timesharing operating systems are optimal throughput, optimal resource utilization, and fairness. In contrast, the main goal of CPU scheduling in real- time operating systems is to process as many time-critical processes as possible, and to meet their deadlines.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part395.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part397.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
