It, however, suffers from the following limitations:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Limited query flexibility. </b>File-oriented approach organizes records in a file according to a key field. Hence, it can quickly process queries based on key field value. However, when the key field is not relevant to desired information, it needs to search the entire file. For example, if the key field is employee-code in an employee file, and if a user needs to list names of all employees having certain educational background, the application has to search all records to produce this information. If the user needs this information frequently, he/she needs to create a new file structured on educational background key with a new program to process this file.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Data redundancy. </b>In file-oriented approach, same data items are often present in many different files. For instance, in the example above of creating a new file structured on educational background key, the new file will also have several data items present in the first employee file. Similarly, let us assume that a bank uses file-oriented approach for storing its customers&#39; data, and it maintains separate customer files for its various types of services, such as savings accounts, term deposits, and loan accounts. In this case, many data items for a bank customer (such as home address, age, occupation, and identification information) may be present in multiple files. Repetition of same data items in more than one file is known as <i>data redundancy</i>. It leads to increase in cost of data entry and data storage. It also leads to data integrity problem described below.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Data integrity problem. </b><i>Data integrity </i>refers to consistency of data in all files. For consistency, the system must carry out any change in a data item in every file containing that data item. For instance, in our example of a bank maintaining separate customer files for each type of account, when a customer moves to a new address, the bank must update his/her address field in all customer files containing this customer&#39;s record. Integrity of data is necessary to avoid confusions that may result when an application updates one file, and does not update the same data present in other files. For example, when an application changes a data item, if it does not update the data item in all files containing the data item, there may be frequent discrepancies among reports, which the application produces from different files, causing confusion.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Lack of program/data independence. </b>In file-oriented approach, an application program usually contains data format statements, which define the format of each data field precisely as the application needs it for processing. Because different applications create</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">different files, this often results in different files having same data item stored using different data formats. <i>Data dependence </i>occurs when data is dependent on application. Due to data dependence problem, whenever there is a need to add, delete, or change data formats, we also need to change application programs. Data dependence problem also causes incompatibility among data files from different applications due to which we cannot link these data files, if such a need arises.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Limited data security flexibility. </b>Normally, a file-oriented approach offers file-level data security feature. Hence, it can enforce data access restrictions on an entire file only, not on a record or a field of data item.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2040">Dissatisfied with these limitations of file-oriented approach, researchers began looking for a better method of organizing data to consolidate activities. Their efforts resulted in database- oriented approach for organizing data. This approach integrates together data from multiple related files in the form of a database having the following properties:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. It provides greater query flexibility.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. It reduces data redundancy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. It solves data integrity (inconsistency) problem.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">4. It makes data independent of application programs, enabling users to add, change, and delete fields from database without affecting existing programs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">5. It also includes data security features at database level, record level, and even at field level to provide greater flexibility of restricted data access.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part404.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part406.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
