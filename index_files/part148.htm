The buyers of these systems only had the option to choose the capacity of secondary storage, but had no option to choose the type of secondary storage device. Today, manufacturers and buyers of these systems have the option to choose between HDD and Solid State Drive (SSD), or a combination of both in the same system. Obviously, to make this choice, we need to know the difference between the two (HDD and SSD) and their relative advantages and disadvantages.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Difference between HDD and SSD</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part148.htm#bookmark1144" class="s23">As explained earlier, an HDD consists of one or more metal platters with read/write heads mounted on access arms in an enclosure (see </a><a href="part148.htm#bookmark1144" class="s3">Figure </a>5.23<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">(a)). The access arms assembly moves the read/write heads to the desired location on the spinning metal platter(s) to read/write data on the disk(s). The disk(s) and the access arm assembly are either permanently fixed inside the system unit (in case of fixed type secondary storage device) or are packaged in a small box enclosure, which can be connected with a short cable to one of the system&#39;s I/O port (in case of portable type secondary storage device).</span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part148.htm#bookmark1144" class="s23">An SSD is a relatively new type of non-volatile storage device used as secondary storage in computer systems. It consists of interconnected flash memory chips, which are installed either on the system&#39;s motherboard (in case of fixed type secondary storage device) or on a separate electronic card (printed circuit board) that is packaged in a small box enclosure, which can be connected with a short cable to one of the system&#39;s I/O port (in case of portable type secondary storage device) (see </a><a href="part148.htm#bookmark1144" class="s3">Figure </a>5.23<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">(b)). The flash memory chips of an SSD are typically faster and more reliable than the flash memory chips used in USB pen drives. Hence, SSD storage is more expensive than USB pen drive storage of same capacity.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1145"><span><img width="430" height="177" alt="image" src="Image_366.jpg"/></span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: -152pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1144">Figure 5.23. </a><span class="s21">Inside view of HDD and SSD. When packaged in an enclosure, both may look similar from outside, but internally their design is different.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part148.htm#bookmark1146" class="s23">Notice that an SSD is built entirely out of semiconductors (hence the name solid state) and does not have any moving parts. On the other hand, an HDD has mechanical components like motors to spin the disk(s) and move the access arms. Due to this, as compared to HDDs, SSDs are more compact in size, quieter in operation, consume less power, have faster data access time and have higher reliability. However, currently SSDs are four to five times costlier than HDDs of same capacity. Hence, SSDs usually have much smaller storage capacity as compared to HDDs. </a><a href="part148.htm#bookmark1146" class="s3">Figure</a></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part148.htm#bookmark1146" class="s3">5.24</a><a href="part148.htm#bookmark1146" class="s24"> </a><a href="part148.htm#bookmark1146" class="s23">provides a detailed comparison of HDD and SSD, with their relative advantages </a>and disadvantages, to enable users to determine which is better for their requirement. Notice from the figure that SSD scores over HDD for most of the attributes except price and storage capacity. Over the last few years, SSD prices have dropped considerably making SSDs as viable alternative to HDDs in many systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Today, desktop-class and laptop-class HDDs are available in 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch form factor respectively. Currently, a 3.5-inch HDD can have storage capacity as high as 10TB. On the other hand, most SSDs of today are available in 2.5-inch form factor having maximum storage capacity of 4TB. Since both HDD and SSD are available in 2.5-inch form factor, a laptop user can replace an existing HDD with an SSD to fit it into the same slot.</p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="506" alt="image" src="Image_367.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: -84pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1146">Figure 5.24. </a><span class="s21">Comparison between HDD and SSD with their relative advantages and disadvantages.
