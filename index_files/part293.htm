Hence, we access an individual element of an array by indexing. An array is a homogeneous data structure in the sense that all elements of an array are of the same data type. It is also linear in the sense that all elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 8.22<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows a few examples of arrays in C language.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="462" height="418" alt="image" src="Image_516.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1601">Figure 8.22. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating the concept of arrays.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Types of Indexing</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We access an individual element of an array by specifying its position in the group of elements with a subscript or index. Depending on the programming language, one of the following three implementations of indexing is possible:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Zero-based indexing. </b><a href="part293.htm#bookmark1601" class="s23">In this case, the first element of an array (also called the “origin” element) is always denoted by subscript value of 0 (zero), increasing monotonically up to one less than the declared size of the array (see </a><a href="part293.htm#bookmark1601" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">8.22</span>). Thus, A[0] is the first element, and A[5] is the fourth element of array “A”. C programming language popularized zero-based indexing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>One-based indexing. </b>In this case, the first element of an array is always denoted by subscript value of 1 (one). Thus, A[1] is the first element, and A[5] is the fifth element of array “A”. Programming languages meant for scientific applications, such as FORTRAN, use one-based indexing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>n-based indexing. </b>In this case, a programmer is free to choose the lower bound of an array (subscript value of first element), which may even be negative to suit the problem at hand.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1602">Types of Arrays</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Based on the binding to subscript value ranges and the binding to storage, arrays are of the following four types:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Static arrays. </b>In a static array, the subscript ranges are statically bound and storage allocation is static (done before run time). The main advantage of static arrays is efficiency because they do not require any dynamic allocation or deallocation of storage.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Semi-static arrays. </b>In a semi-static array, the subscript ranges are statically bound, but storage allocation is done at declaration elaboration time during execution. The main advantage of semi-static arrays over static arrays is storage space efficiency. For example, a large array in one procedure can use the same storage space as a large array in another procedure, as long as the two procedures are never active at the same time.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Semi-dynamic arrays. </b>In a semi-dynamic array, the subscript ranges are dynamically bound and storage allocation is dynamic (done during run time). However, once the subscript ranges are bound and storage space is allocated, they remain fixed during the lifetime of the array. The main advantage of semi-dynamic arrays over static and semi- static arrays is flexibility. The size of an array need not be known until the array is about to be used.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Dynamic arrays. </b>In a dynamic array, the binding of subscript ranges and storage allocation is dynamic and can change any number of times during the array&#39;s lifetime. The main advantage of dynamic arrays over other types is greater flexibility. A dynamic array can grow and shrink during program execution as the need for space changes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multi-dimensional Arrays</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part293.htm#bookmark1601" class="s23">In </a><a href="part293.htm#bookmark1601" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">8.22</span>, we saw examples of arrays in which each array element is indexed by a single integer. Such arrays are called <i>one-dimensional arrays</i>. Several numerical and graphics applications use <i>multidimensional arrays </i>in which each array element is indexed by an ordered list of same number of integers. For example, each array element is indexed by an ordered list of two integers (such as A[3, 5]) in a two-dimensional array, and by an ordered list of three integers (such as B[1, 3, 4]) in a three-dimensional array. Hence, an array in which each array element is indexed by an ordered list of <i>k </i>integers is called <i>k-dimensional array</i><a href="part293.htm#bookmark1603" class="s23">. </a><a href="part293.htm#bookmark1603" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">8.23</span> shows an example of a two-dimensional array.

This is because the memory of a computer itself is a large one-dimensional array.

Thus, the universal need for arrays is obvious. For example, computer programs often use arrays for representation of strings, vectors, and matrices. Arrays can also have arrays as elements. Computer programs use arrays of arrays for creation of <i>ragged arrays </i>(also called <i>jagged arrays</i><a href="part293.htm#bookmark1607" class="s23">), in which the valid of three elements.
