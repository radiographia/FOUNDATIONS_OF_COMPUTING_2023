They use thermal, electrostatic, chemical, or inkjet technology to produce printed output. Impact printers can produce multiple copies by using carbon in a single print cycle, which is not possible with a non-impact printer. However, impact printers are noisy in operation and normally use a cover to reduce noise level. Non-impact printers are quiet in operation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Printing speed. </b>According to this classification, printers are classified as character, line, and page printers. As the names imply, a <i>character printer </i>prints one character at a time, a <i>line printer </i>prints one line at a time, and a <i>page printer </i>prints an entire page at a time. Accordingly, we measure printer speeds in <i>characters-per-second </i>(<i>cps </i>) for character printers, <i>lines-per-minute </i>(<i>lpm</i>) for line printers, and <i>pages-per-minute </i>(<i>ppm</i>) for page printers. Print-speed ranges for the three types of printers are 40 to 450 cps, 1000 to 5000 lpm, and 4 to 800 ppm.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Printing quality. </b>Quality of printed output is directly proportional to resolution of printing, measured in dots per inch (dpi). The dpi qualifier refers to the capability of a printer to print number of dots per linear inch, horizontally or vertically. That is, a 300-dpi printer is capable of printing 90,000 (300 × 300) dots per square inch. According to this classification, we classify printers as <i>near-letter-quality </i>(<i>NLQ</i>),<i>letter-quality </i>(<i>LQ</i>), <i>near- typeset-quality </i>( <i>NTQ</i>), and <i>typeset-quality </i>(<i>TQ</i>). The resolution of near-letter-quality printers is about 300 dpi, letter-quality printers is about 600 dpi, near-typeset-quality printers is about 1200 dpi, and typeset-quality printers is about 2000 dpi. Users use NLQ and LQ printers for ordinary day-to-day printing jobs, and NTQ and TQ printers for top- quality professional printing, such as in publishing industries.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Language scripts. </b>Printers are available in almost all scripts, such as, English, Devnagari, Japanese, Arabic, etc. According to this classification, printers are classified based on the scripts (also called <i>fonts</i>) supported. A printer may support multiple scripts simultaneously to print in multiple languages. For example, a printer may be capable of printing in both English and Devanagari.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Color. </b>Printers can print either in a single color (such as black, red, blue), or in two to three colors (such as a document printed in black and white with keywords printed in red), or in multiple colors. Although printers that print in a single or two to three colors are suitable for printing textual documents, multi-color printers are desirable for printing other types of documents, such as those containing graphs and images.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Different types of printers available today are dot-matrix, inkjet, drum, chain/band, laser, and hydra printers. They are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1287">Dot-Matrix Printers</a></h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part194.htm#bookmark1288" class="s23">Dot-matrix printers are character printers that print one character at a time.

Hence, they can print special characters, different sizes of print, and graphics such as charts and graphs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dot-matrix printers are impact printers because they print by hammering pins on an inked ribbon to leave ink impressions on a paper. Hence, we can use them for producing multiple copies by using carbon paper or its equivalent. Due to impact printing, dot-matrix printers are noisy as compared to non-impact printers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dot-matrix printers are usually monochrome. However, some dot-matrix printers use a ribbon having rows of two to three colors to produce printed output in few colors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dot-matrix printers are slow, having printing speeds in the range of 30 to 600 characters per second. However, they are cheap in terms of both initial cost and cost of operation. Hence, individuals and organizations prefer them for generating hard-copy outputs, if the speed and quality of printing are not important factors. They also use them for applications requiring multi- copy output such as shipping forms and invoices that rely on impact printing for generating multiple copies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Inkjet Printers</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part194.htm#bookmark1293" class="s23">Inkjet printers are character printers that form characters and images by spraying small drops of ink on a paper. The print head of an inkjet printer contains up to 64 tiny nozzles. The printer can heat up the nozzles selectively in a few microseconds by an integrated circuit resistor. When the resistor heats up, the ink near it vaporizes and ejects through the nozzle making a dot on the paper placed in front of the print head. To print a character, the printer selectively heats the appropriate set of nozzles as the print head moves horizontally. </a><a href="part194.htm#bookmark1293" class="s3">Figure </a>6.28<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows an inkjet printer.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Inkjet printers produce higher quality output than dot-matrix printers do, because they form characters by very tiny ink dots. A high-resolution inkjet printer has as many as 64 nozzles within a height of 7mm, providing print resolution of around 360 dots per inch.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 172pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="180" height="110" alt="image" src="Image_416.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1293">Figure 6.28. </a><span class="s21">An inkjet printer.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Inkjet printers can print any shape or characters that a program can describe as patterns of tiny dots.

Hence, they are quieter in operation, but we cannot use them for producing multiple copies of a document in a single printing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Inkjet printers are both monochrome and color. A monochrome inkjet printer uses a single cartridge with black ink, whereas a color inkjet printer uses two ink cartridges - black and tri- color. The tri-color cartridge contains red, blue, and green colors in a package that can mix appropriate amount of these colors with black from the other cartridge to get any desired color. Hence, inkjet printers can produce multi-colored and photo-quality output.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1294">Inkjet printers are slower than dot-matrix printers, with printing speeds ranging from 40 to 300 characters per second. They are costlier than dot-matrix printers. Users prefer them for better quality output, if speed of printing is not an important factor.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Drum Printers</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part194.htm#bookmark1295" class="s23">Drum printers are line printers that print one line at a time. </a><a href="part194.htm#bookmark1295" class="s3">Figure </a>6.29<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows the print mechanism of a drum printer. It consists of a solid cylindrical drum with characters embossed (raised characters) on its surface in the form of circular bands. Each band consists of all printing characters supported by the printer in its character set. Total number of bands is equal to the maximum number of characters (print positions) that the printer can print on a line. Hence, a drum printer with 132 characters per line and supporting a character set of 96 characters will have altogether 12,672 (132×96) characters embossed on its surface.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to the drum, the printer has a set of hammers (one opposite each band) mounted in front of the drum in a manner that an inked ribbon and paper can be placed between the hammers and the drum. The total number of hammers is equal to the total number of bands on the drum, which is also equal to the total print positions per line.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part194.htm#bookmark1297" class="s23">The drum rotates at a high speed. To print a character at a desired print position, the printer activates the appropriate hammer when the character embossed on the band at the print position passes below it. Hence, the drum would have to complete one full revolution to print each line of output. This means that the printer does not print all characters on a line at exactly the same time, but the time required to print an entire line is so fast that it appears as if it prints one line at a time. </a><a href="part194.htm#bookmark1297" class="s3">Figure </a>6.30<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows a drum printer.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The drum of a drum printer is expensive and we cannot change it often.

This allows use of different fonts (styles of characters) and different scripts (languages) with the same printer.

Main components of a laser printer are a laser beam source, a multi-sided mirror, a photoconductive drum, and toner (tiny particles of oppositely charged ink). To print a page of output, the printer focuses the laser beam on the electro statically charged drum by the spinning multi-sided mirror. The mirror focuses the laser beam on the surface of the drum in a manner to create the patterns of characters/images that the printer has to print on the page. Since the drum is photoconductive, print mechanism creates a difference in electric charge on those parts of the drum surface, which are exposed to the laser beam. As a result, the toner, composed of oppositely charged ink particles, sticks to the drum in the places where the laser beam has charged the drum&#39;s surface. The printer then applies heat and pressure to fuse the toner permanently on the paper to generate the printed output. It then rotates</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part194.htm#bookmark1301" class="s23">the drum and cleans it with a rubber blade to remove the toner sticking to its surface to prepare the drum for next page printing. </a>Figure 6.33<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows a laser printer.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 198pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="111" height="130" alt="image" src="Image_420.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1300">Figure 6.32. </a><span class="s21">A chain/band printer.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 175pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="172" height="145" alt="image" src="Image_421.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1301">Figure 6.33. </a><span class="s21">A laser printer.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Laser printers produce high quality output because they form characters by tiny ink particles. The most common laser printers have resolution of 600 dpi (dots per inch), whereas some high- end laser printers have resolution of 1200 dpi. Due to their high resolution, these printers give excellent graphics art quality.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Laser printers can print any shape of characters that a program can describe as patterns generated by the laser beam. Hence, they can print special characters, different sizes of print, and graphics such as charts and graphs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Laser printers are non-impact printers. Hence, they are quiet in operation, but we cannot use them for producing multiple copies of a document in a single printing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although, earlier laser printers could print only in black color, because they had a single toner- drum arrangement, now color laser printers are also available at affordable price. A color laser printer has four-color toners, each with a drum of its own. It uses the drums and toners in the same manner as described above, but charges each drum in such a way that together they produce the desired color output.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Laser printers are faster in printing speed than other printers discussed earlier.
