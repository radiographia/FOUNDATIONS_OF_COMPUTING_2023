The backup procedure creates a copy of every file from the on-line secondary storage device on to the backup device, irrespective of whether the file was changed or not. Depending on the volume of data being backed up and backup device used, full backups can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to complete.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Incremental backup. </b>Backup is an expensive process both in terms of time taken to complete and storage space occupied on backup device. To save on backup time and storage space, one can often go for incremental backup instead of full backup. This method copies only newly created files or files changed since the last backup from on-line secondary storage device to the backup device at the time of backup. As every file stored in a system contains the date and time of its creation and last update, incremental backup utility software compares these dates to those in its log for deciding which are the newly created and modified files since the last backup.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1194">Incremental backup is faster than full backup because it creates a copy of only the new and modified files since the last backup. This may result in copying of only a few files out of hundreds of files stored on the on-line secondary storage device. However, full backup is simpler and a little safer for restoring data back from the backup device on to the on-line secondary storage device. If we want to restore a particular file that was lost, we need to search for it at only one place in case of full backup, whereas in case of incremental backup, we need to search for it on several backups tracing back from the most recent backup until we find the file. Similarly, in the event of a disk crash, when all the files are lost, it is easy to restore the files back on to a new disk with full backup as compared to incremental backup because the full backup is a mirror image of the entire disk and the system can restore it as it is.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part174.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part176.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
