Some important uses of the Internet are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2336">1. </a><b>Online teaching/learning. </b>Although online teaching/learning has been around for several years, we saw its large scale usage during the COVID-19 pandemic. It refers to Internet- based distance teaching/learning model, which is known by many different terminologies such as e-learning, distance learning, digital learning, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), etc. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students at all levels (college, secondary</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">school, and elementary school) were unable to attend classes physically for almost two years. To maintain student learning during this period, almost all schools and colleges across the world adopted online teaching/learning by using the Internet along with required hardware equipment and software tools.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Online communication. </b>Computer users around the world make extensive use of e-mail service on the Internet to communicate with each other. Many users also use “chat” facility to communicate with each other in real-time. For example, the Internet sites <i>webmessengeryahoo.com </i>and <i>facebook.com </i>provide “chat” facility. With e-mail and chat facilities, the Internet has become a rapid and productive communication tool for billions of users.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Software sharing. </b>The Internet provides access to a large number of shareware software, development tools, and utilities. For example, Free Software Foundation provides a wealth of GNU software tools on the Internet, which a user can download free of charge. For more details on software tools offered by Free Software Foundation, you can anonymous <i>ftp </i>to the Internet site <i>prep.at.mit.edu</i>, and look in the directory <i>/pub/GNU</i>. The Internet sites <i>filehippo.com </i>and <i>isohunt.com </i>also offer free downloadable software.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Exchange of views on topics of common interest. </b>The Internet has a number of news groups. Each news group enables a group of users to exchange their views on some topic of common interest. For example, the news group <i>SearchWinIT.com </i>contains views of Microsoft Windows administrators and computing managers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Posting of information of general interest. </b>Many users use the Internet as a large electronic bulletin board, and post on it information of general interest to bring it to the attention of interested users around the world. Some such information includes career opportunities, conference and event announcements, and calls for papers for conferences and journals. For example, <i>erodov.com </i>is such a website for technology news and reviews.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Organization promotion. </b>Today, most organizations create their own websites to disseminate timely information about corporate happenings, product announcements, recent strategic alliances, press releases, and other information of potential interest to all concerned.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Product promotion and feedback about products. </b>Commercial organizations also use the Internet to promote their products/services and to gather information about user satisfaction of existing products, market opportunities of new products, and ideas for potential new products. An organization accomplishes this by putting up information about its products/services on its website, and having an interactive survey application on its website.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. <b>Customer support service. </b>Many organizations also use the Internet to provide timely customer support. The combined e-mail, ftp, and other services on the Internet provide necessary enabling tools for such first-rate customer support. For example, users of a software product can report bugs in the software to the organization that owns the software by e-mail, and the organization can make available to its customers bug fixes, minor releases, workarounds, known problems and limitations, and general advice about the product via an <i>ftp </i>server.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">9. <b>Online journals, magazines, encyclopedia, and dictionary. </b>The Internet now has</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.timesofindia.com/" class="s23" target="_blank">literally thousands of electronic subscriptions found both for free and low cost. There are many WWW sites on the Internet dealing with electronic versions of many journals and magazines. There are also sites, which provide access to electronic encyclopedia and/or dictionary. For example, the Internet edition of the Times of India newspaper is available at the Internet site </a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12pt;">www.timesofindia.com</span>. The site <i>wikipedia.org </i>provides an online encyclopedia and the site <i>wiktionary.org </i>provides an online dictionary. Researchers have extended this idea to support full-fledged electronic libraries (called <i>digital library</i>) on the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2337">10. </a><b>Online shopping. </b>The Internet has facilitated introduction of a new market concept consisting of virtual shops. These shops remain open 24 hours all the year round, and are accessible to purchasers all around the world. They provide information about products or services for sale through WWW servers. Using the Internet services, customers submit specific product queries and request specific sales quotes. Through a well-defined authorization and authentication scheme, the virtual shops use the Internet services to accept orders placed by customers, to handle order payments, and to track orders to fulfillment. For example, the Internet site <i>amazon.com </i>is such a virtual shop on the Internet, which has information on all types of products, and accepts orders for them on- line.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. <b>Worldwide video conferencing. </b>Worldwide video conferencing on the Internet allows a group of users located around the globe to talk and interact with each other, as if they were sitting and discussing in a single room. The parties interacting can see each other talking on their computer screens and can hear each other&#39;s voice through a special audio- device fixed in their computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">12. <b>Worldwide webcasting. </b>Today, many organizations use the Internet to distribute a single audio or video content to many simultaneous listeners or viewers worldwide. The act of using the Internet for broadcasting of such content is known as <i>webcasting</i>. A webcasting software distributes over the Internet a media file containing audio or video content to many simultaneous listeners or viewers. It uses streaming media technology to do so. A webcasting software may distribute a media file either live or on-demand. E-learning programs use webcasting to deliver lectures or seminars to an interested group with worldwide participation.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Webinar <span class="p">is a new terminology, which refers to webcasting of a seminar. Politicians use webcasting to deliver talks to a wider audience. Commercial organizations use webcasting to make corporate presentations or announcements of their new products and services to their existing and prospective customers located worldwide. Virtually  all  major broadcasters  have  webcast  of  their  output  including  BBC,  CNN,  and  UNTV. </span>ezwebpresentation.com <span class="p">offers webcasting services.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part496.htm">Intranet</a><a class="toc0" href="part497.htm">Proxy Server</a><a class="toc0" href="part498.htm">Internet Telephony</a><a class="toc0" href="part499.htm">Microbrowser</a><a class="toc0" href="part500.htm">Next Generation Internet Protocol (IPV6)</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part494.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part496.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
