That is, an OOP language must have mechanisms to define, create, store, and manipulate objects, and some mechanism to allow different objects to communicate with each other. The basic concepts used in OOP languages to support the object mechanism are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Object</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An <i>object </i>is the primitive element of a program written in an OOP language. Each object consists of a set of procedures (known as methods) and some data. It stores the data in variables and responds to messages received from other objects by executing the procedures (methods). A <i>method </i>is a collection of operations that specifies the reaction of the object when it receives a message that corresponds to that method.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A program written in a pure OOP language is a collection of objects that communicate with each</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">other. Virtually everything, from items as simple as an integer constant ‘8’ to a complex file- handling system, is an object. An OOP language treats them all uniformly as objects. They all have local memory, inherent processing ability, the capability to communicate with other objects, and the ability to inherit characteristics from ancestors.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We can view an object as an abstract data type because each object is an autonomous entity with its private data and methods. Note that an object contains both functions (procedures/methods) and data that describe the characteristics of the object. In other words, an object encapsulates both data and functions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Method</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A <i>method </i>of an object defines the set of operations that the object will execute when it receives a message corresponding to the method. Methods are like function definitions, complete with parameters and the capability to return values. Binding of a message to a method is dynamic. The entire collection of methods of an object is called the <i>message protocol</i>, or <i>message interface</i><a href="part323.htm#bookmark1753" class="s23">, of the object. </a><a href="part323.htm#bookmark1753" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">9.13</span> illustrates the object model used in OOP.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="346" height="154" alt="image" src="Image_580.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1753">Figure 9.13. </a><span class="s21">Model of an object used in OOP.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Message</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The mechanism to support communication between objects is through messages. That is, OOP language programs do any computing by sending a message to an object to invoke one of its methods. A reply to a message is an object, which returns to the sender the result of executing the method.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is a fundamental difference between a message sent to an object and a subprogram call. In the former case, the object executes the appropriate method with its own local data, whereas in the latter case, the caller process sends the data for processing (if any) to the subprogram code unit along with the subprogram call.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1754">Class</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A <i>class </i>is a description of one or more similar objects. Class concept is similar to “type” in conventional procedure-oriented languages. For example, if “integer” is a type (class), then “8” is an instance (object) of type (class) “integer”. Similarly, “Ram” and “Sita” are two instances (objects) of a class “Person”.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A class can have multiple instances. Each instance of a class is known as an object of the class.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Each object has its own local data and represents a different instance of its class. Since all objects of a class share the same methods, the only difference between two objects of the same class is the state of their local variables. Also, note that there can be two categories of object variables - class variables and instance variables. <i>Class variables </i>are variables stored in the class. All instances (objects) of the class share its class variables. <i>Instance variables </i>are variables for which local storage is available in the instances (objects).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Object-oriented programming languages also support class hierarchies. <i>Sub-classes </i>of a given class are refinements of it, inheriting the functionality and local variables of the parent-class, or super-class. Sub-classes can add new local variables and methods, and can modify or hide inherited methods.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inheritance</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In OOP, <i>inheritance </i>is a mechanism to share code and behavior. It allows a programmer to reuse the behavior of a class in the definition of new classes. A program written in an object-oriented language may have a large hierarchy of classes. In fact, good programming in an object-oriented language depends largely on creating sub-classes of existing classes, because this leads to potential reuse of existing code.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a hierarchy of classes, a sub-class inherits all of the instance variables, instance methods, and class methods of its super-class/parent-class. The sub-class can also have its own instance variables, which must have different names than the variable names in its ancestor classes. Finally, the sub-class can define both new methods and methods that already exist in an ancestor class. When a sub-class has a method whose name or protocol is the same as an ancestor class, the sub-class method hides that of the ancestor class. Normally, a user has to prefix the message with the pseudo-variable “super” to access such a hidden method. This causes the method search to begin in the super-class rather than locally.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Inheritance need not get limited to one parent-class. A child class can inherit from multiple parent classes. This is called <i>multiple inheritance</i>.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part323.htm#bookmark1755" class="s3">Figure </a>9.14<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">describes persons by an inheritance hierarchy of classes (representing behaviors). “Person” class has “Male” and “Female” as its sub-classes. “Male” class has “Person” as its super-class and “Boy” and “Man” as its sub-classes. Each instance (Ram, Shyam, Mohan, Seeta, and Geeta) has a unique base class.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="465" height="158" alt="image" src="Image_581.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1755">Figure 9.14. </a><span class="s21">Example of an inheritance hierarchy of classes.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s46" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Figure 9.15<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">illustrates the concepts of object, class, and inheritance with the help of an example. In the example, object ‘a’ is an instance of class ‘A’ and object ‘b’ is an instance of class ‘B’.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1756">Both A and B define behavior by operations shared by their instances, and have instance variables that cause a private copy to be created for each instance for the class or sub-class. Instance ‘a’ of class ‘A’ has a copy of A’s instance variables and a pointer to its base class. Instance ‘b’ of class ‘B’ has a copy of the instance variables of both class ‘B’ and its super-class ‘A’ and a pointer to the base class of ‘B’. Representation of class ‘B’ has a pointer to its super- class ‘A’, while class ‘A’ has no super-class pointer, since it has no super-class.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When object ‘b’ receives a message to execute a method, it looks first in the methods of class ‘B’. If it finds the method in class ‘B’, it executes it using the instance variables of ‘b’ as data. Otherwise, it follows the pointer to its super-class. If it finds the method in class ‘A’, it executes it on the data of ‘b’. Otherwise, it searches A&#39;s super-class if there is one. If it did not find the method in class ‘A’ and if class ‘A’ has no super-class, it reports an error.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="436" height="252" alt="image" src="Image_582.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1757">Figure 9.15. </a><span class="s21">An example illustrating the concepts of object, class, and inheritance.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part322.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part324.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
