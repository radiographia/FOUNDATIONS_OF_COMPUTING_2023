It offers computational power (resources, services, data) to its users in the same manner as electrical power and other utilities are available today to their users. For example, consider the analogy between an electric power grid and a grid computing system. In an electrical power grid, users of electrical power simply turn on the light or plugin their electrical equipment without caring about where the power comes from. Similarly, in a grid computing system, users simply submit their jobs to the system, and the system internally takes care of providing the best possible resources to run the jobs. Users do not have to care about where the resources required to run their jobs are located, and how the system makes them available for their jobs. Users also pay only for the resources used by their jobs, just as users pay for the amount of electrical power consumed.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To achieve its goal stated above, grid-computing infrastructure seamlessly integrates and aggregates a variety of geographically distributed resources, such as supercomputers, storage systems, data sources, data acquisition instruments, and special devices and services, which users can then use as a unified resource. Additionally, it provides a service-oriented architecture by using standardized protocols and services to enable secure discovery, access to, and interactions among distributed resources, services, and applications. The system internally implements coordinated sharing of distributed hardware, software, and information resources. Often the aggregated resources are across organization boundaries, and grid computing helps in creating a <i>virtual organization </i>of the resources and their users.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">By its very nature, a grid computing system (grid infrastructure, grid execution environment, and grid applications) has the following characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Heterogeneous resources. </b>A grid computing system often aggregates a large number of independent, distributed, and heterogeneous hardware, software, and information resources as a unified resource.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Dynamic execution environment. </b>Execution environment of a grid computing system changes dynamically during the lifetime of an application depending on the availability and the state of resources, services, and data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Uncertain  execution  environment.  </b>Dynamism  (discussed  above),  failures  of communication and system resources, and incomplete knowledge of global system state cause uncertainty of execution environment of a grid computing system. Grid applications must be capable of dealing with these uncertainties.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A few examples of grid-computing systems include NSF&#39;s (National Science Foundation, USA) TeraGrid, EU&#39;s (European Union) DataGrid, Japan&#39;s NaReGI (National Research Grid initiative), and India&#39;s Garuda. There have also been several initiatives for building grid computing systems involving just a few institutions in a specific application domain (health informatics, tele- education, etc.).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part472.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part474.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
