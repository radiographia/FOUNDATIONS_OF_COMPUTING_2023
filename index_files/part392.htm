On the other hand, iOS is the operating system designed by Apple Incorporation for its mobile devices such as iPad, iPhone and iPod. Its first version was released in 2007. Apple originally designed it for iPhone and named it iPhone OS, but later changed its name to iOS because of its use on other mobile devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Operating systems for mobile devices need to provide a protective shell for each application (app) to prevent other apps from tampering them. Although, the protective shell of an app protects it from other apps, it also prevents direct communication between two apps. iOS introduced an extensibility feature, which lets two apps communicate directly, if approved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1985">The salient features of iOS include the following:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Highly intuitive user interface </b>with multi-touch features that makes Apple&#39;s mobile devices much easier to use than other similar devices. For example, a user can just swipe his/her finger on the screen to flip through the next page of a displayed document, or can just pinch his/her fingers on the screen to zoom in/out the displayed document. The user can even touch an object (text, photo, file, etc.) on the screen, and drag and drop it from one application to another.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Facility to write, mark and draw. </b>In addition to keyboard input, iOS allows a user to use Apple Pencil for writing free-hand notes, marking important portions of a document, and drawing free-hand sketches. Handwritten words in notes are even searchable.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Facility to ask for information or instruct using voice interface. </b>Siri is a voice based intelligent assistant facility supported by iOS. A user can ask it to do simple things like setting an alarm at a specific time, sending a message to a registered user, or asking to make a call to a registered user.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Interoperable with Mac OS and WatchOS</b>, which enables users to share data and activities across various types of Apple devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Supported with a large set of applications and games</b>. Apple&#39;s AppStore has a large set of built-in applications and games for its mobile device users. Users of mobile devices by default get a set of commonly used applications when they acquire an Apple device. Users can download other applications and games of their choice from the AppStore.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>iCloud facility </b>enables a user to store his/her data (photos, videos, music, documents, presentations, etc.) on Apple&#39;s cloud and access the same from any Apple device. For example, a user can create and upload documents from his/her iPad in iCloud, and then access it from his/her iPhone, whenever required. The user can even share his/her iCloud Drive link with his/her friends/relatives/colleagues to share his/her data stored in the iCloud with them. This facility makes users data accessible from anywhere.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Multitasking facility </b>of iOS allows a user to open multiple applications simultaneously in either SlipView or SlideOver mode. In former mode, both applications are visible simultaneously in different parts of the screen, while in latter mode, the user slides to the desired application window whenever required.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. <b>Camera, music and maps </b>are other in-built facilities with supported applications that make user experience exciting with Apple mobile devices. iOS has several features for all these.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. <b>Privacy and security features help users work in a trusted environment. </b>Designers of iOS built it from the ground up with privacy and security in mind. iOS supports both biometric and password based user authentication. Moreover, it protects personal information of users and their data with strong encryption and strict security policies that govern how the system handles various types of data.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part391.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part393.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
