It cannot handle all the requests for certificates in the world efficiently, and would become a performance bottleneck.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. <b>Reliability. </b>It is not a reliable solution. It suffers from a single point of failure. Failure of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the CA would bring down Internet security to a halt.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hence, in addition to the concept of CA, IETF evolved and proposed the use of an entire infrastructure for issue and management of public keys. This infrastructure is called PKI. It consists of a set of hardware, software, people, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, store, distribute, and revoke digital certificates based on public-key cryptography. It enables secure, convenient, and efficient issuing and management of public keys.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PKI has the following elements:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>End entity. </b>It denotes a subject that makes certificate related requests (issue of a new certificate, revocation of a certificate, key pair update, key pair recovery, etc). A subject can be a person (user) or a device (server, router, etc.).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Certification Authority (CA). </b>A CA issues and revokes certificates. Revocation of an issued certificate is required when a subject holding the certificate abuses it in some way, or the subject&#39;s private key is somehow exposed, or the CA&#39;s private key is compromised. PKI&#39;s mechanism for revocation of certificates is that a CA periodically issues a <i>CRL </i>( <i>Certificate Revocation List</i>) giving serial numbers of all certificates that it has revoked.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PKI allows existence of multiple CAs. A simple form of PKI is a hierarchy of CAs. The top-level CA is called the root. It certifies second-level CAs, which are called <i>RAs </i>( <i>Regional Authorities</i>) because each RA normally covers a geographic region, such as a country. These in turn certify the next level CAs and so on. Actually, the leaf-CAs issue the X.509 certificates to end entities. When a CA authorizes a new CA below it, it generates an X.509 certificate stating that it has approved the new CA, includes the new CA&#39;s public key in it, signs it, and hands it to the new CA. When a leaf CA issues a certificate to an end entity, it generates an X.509 certificate and issues a signed hash of the certificate to the end entity along with the certificate.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The assumption in PKI is that everyone knows the root&#39;s public key. To avoid the problem of deciding who runs the root, PKI allows many roots. Hence, a hierarchical PKI is actually a forest of CAs with many trees of CAs, each tree having its own root. To make public keys of roots known to end entities, modern browsers come pre-loaded with public keys of over 100 roots, which are known as <i>trust anchors</i>. In this manner, PKI avoids the requirement of having a single worldwide trusted authority.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Repository. </b>It denotes the method, which a PKI uses for storing certificates and CRLs so that the system can service requests of end entities easily and quickly. Obviously, the method also decides the place where the system stores the certificates and CRLs. PKI systems use DNS and X.500 directory standards for this purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2659">PKI supports the following management functions:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Registration. </b>It enables an end entity (a user) to enroll itself in a PKI. The user first registers itself with a CA using this function. Registration process involves mutual authentication of the user and the CA, and issue of one or more shared secret keys to the user by the CA. The user uses it for subsequent authentication.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Initialization. </b>It installs necessary client software on a client&#39;s system (an end entity&#39;s system) to enable it to operate securely in the PKI system of which the client system becomes part on registration with a CA. Client software establishes relationship with keys</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">stored elsewhere in the infrastructure.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Certification. </b>It issues a certificate for a user&#39;s public key and returns the certificate to the user&#39;s system (client system) and/or publishes that certificate on a website or a public bulletin board.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Cross certification. </b>It enables two CAs to establish a cross certificate. A cross-certificate is a certificate, which a CA issues to another CA that contains a CA signature key for issuing certificates (recall the hierarchical PKI structure in which the root certifies second- level CAs, which in turn certify the next-level CAs, and so on).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Revocation. </b>It enables an authorized entity to request a CA for revocation of a certificate. The request includes the reason for revocation (such as compromise of private key, change of name or affiliation of a user, etc.)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Key pair recovery. </b>It enables a user (end entity) to recover a lost key of a key pair. We saw that several security mechanisms (such as encryption and decryption of information; creation and verification of digital signatures; etc.) deal with a pair of keys, and will cease to function if one of the keys is lost. Loss of key may happen due to various reasons such as a user forgetting a password, a hard disk crash, etc. In such a situation, a user uses this function to recover a key of a key pair from an authorized backup facility, which the CA that issued the user&#39;s certificate normally maintains.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Key pair update. </b>A certificate normally has a lifetime associated with it, after which it expires. Hence, a certificate needs update either when its lifetime expires or on a valid revocation request. The system uses this function to update certificates (key pairs).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part588.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part590.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
