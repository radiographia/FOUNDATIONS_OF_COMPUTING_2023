Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie developed UNIX in early 1970s at Bell Laboratories for a PDP-11 computer. It was the first operating system written in a high-level language, C. Earlier operating systems were written in assembly language, due to which they were system dependent (were usable only on a system for which they were developed). However, since UNIX was written in C language, moving it to a new system, known as <i>porting </i>it, was much easier. This was an important reason for its popularity and availability on a wide variety of systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BSD Unix and Other Unix Versions</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unix was versatile and easy to modify. Hence, several universities and research laboratories initiated Unix-based development activities. The most influential of the non-AT&amp;T development groups was the group at the University of California at Berkeley. This group ported Unix to the VAX computer and produced the Berkeley Software Distributions (BSD) versions of Unix. Among the improvements made by this group in the original Unix version, the notable ones were support for virtual memory, demand paging, a new shell (called <i>csh</i>), and the TCP/IP network protocols. BSD version also added several OS capability enhancement software to Unix, including a new text editor (called <i>vi editor</i>), Pascal and Lisp compilers, and many more.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Over the years, as Unix grew in popularity, many computer vendors ported it on their systems, and enhanced and maintained their own versions of Unix. This resulted in creation of a wide variety of Unix, and Unix-like operating systems. For example, Unix supported on IBM systems is called <i>AIX</i>, Unix supported on systems supplied by Sun Microsystems is called <i>Solaris</i>, Unix supported on systems supplied by DEC (Digital Equipment Coporation) is called <i>Ultrix</i>, and Unix supported on systems supplied by HP (Hewelett Packard) is called <i>HP-Unix</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structure of Unix</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unix operating system has the following three layers:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Kernel. </b>This layer has all the modules for process, memory, file, device, and security management.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Shell. </b>This layer has the command interpreter. Unix basically provides a command-line interface (some vendors have added GUI to their new versions of Unix). The shell provides a large number of useful commands. Every command does a single, specific task. To do larger, more complex tasks, users can combine several commands in the form of a shell script to produce the result they want. A user can even store a shell script in an executable file. When the user executes the file, it acts like a new shell command.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Shell provides an interesting service called <i>pipe </i>(denoted by |), which allows users to send the output of one program to the input of another program without storing the output of the first program in a temporary file. For example, entering:</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 231pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">who <span class="p">ç </span>sort</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">invokes the command <i>who</i>, which displays the names of all users logged in currently, and pipes its output to <i>sort</i>. The result is a sorted list of currently logged in users. A <i>pipeline </i>is a connection of two or more programs through pipes. The length of a pipeline can be arbitrarily long. Programs that form a pipeline are called <i>filter programs </i>(or just <i>filters</i>) because they act as data filters, transforming the data as it passes from one program to the next program in the pipeline.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1973">3. </a><b>Utilities. </b>This layer has all the OS capability enhancement software, including language compilers, text editors, text-processing programs, and a variety of utilities and tools. Over the years, this layer has grown to include several powerful tools, which allow effective program development and system management. Because of this, many users refer to Unix as a complete programming environment, not just an operating system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part385.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part387.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
