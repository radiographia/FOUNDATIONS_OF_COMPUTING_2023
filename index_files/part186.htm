Text-mode interaction being cumbersome, time-consuming, and limited in scope of operation, computer designers came up with a new type of user interface, called </a><i>graphical user interface (GUI)</i><a href="part186.htm#bookmark1241" class="s23">. A GUI provides a screen with graphic icons (small images on the screen) or menus and allows a user to make rapid selections from them to give instructions to a computer (see </a><a href="part186.htm#bookmark1241" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.3</span>). GUI requires an input device with which a user can rapidly point to and select a graphic icon or menu item from multiple options displayed on the screen. The keyboard, though usable, is inconvenient and unsuitable for this requirement. Hence, research efforts to find a suitable input device to meet this requirement gave birth to several input devices like mouse, track ball, joystick, light pen, and touch screen. Many of these devices, like mouse and light pen, are also useful for creating graphic elements on the screen such as lines, curves, and freehand shapes. With this new ability, manufacturers and users of these devices started calling them point-and-draw devices. These devices enable computers to be used by a wide range of users including children, illiterate citizens, and graphic designers. Some commonly used point-and-draw devices are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="389" height="237" alt="image" src="Image_388.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1241">Figure 6.3. </a><span class="s21">A graphical user interface (GUI) of Microsoft® Windows desktop.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mouse</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part186.htm#bookmark1242" class="s23">A mouse is a small hand-held device that fits comfortably in a user&#39;s palm (see </a><a href="part186.htm#bookmark1242" class="s3">Figure </a>6.4<span class="p">). It rolls on a small bearing and has one or more buttons on the top. When a user rolls a mouse (connected to a user terminal) on a flat surface, a graphics cursor moves on the terminal screen in the direction of the mouse&#39;s movement. Since movements of the graphics cursor on the screen reproduce all movements of the mouse, we can easily position the graphics cursor at a menu item or an icon by using the mouse.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1243"><span><img width="147" height="151" alt="image" src="Image_389.jpg"/></span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1242">Figure 6.4. </a><span class="s21">A mouse.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="26" height="12" alt="image" src="Image_390.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Different applications display the <i>graphics cursor </i>as different symbols such as an arrow <span><img width="20" height="14" alt="image" src="Image_391.jpg"/></span>, a wrist with a pointing finger   etc. An application may also display the text and graphics cursor on the screen simultaneously. The graphics cursor, irrespective of its size and shape, has a pixel- size point that is the point of reference to decide the position of the cursor on the screen. This point is called <i>hot spot </i>of the graphics cursor. The graphics cursor points to a menu item or icon, when a user positions the hot spot on it. With a click of the mouse&#39;s button, a user can notify the system of this choice. This is much easier than notifying a choice by pressing various key combinations. With proper software, we can also use a mouse to draw pictures on the screen and edit text.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mouse Operations</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 6.5<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">lists simple operations to carry out various functions with a mouse.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A mouse reports movement and button click events in a sequential stream as they happen. The system codes them as multi-byte records. The first byte is event type, and the following bytes are particulars of the event (the change in vertical and horizontal position of the mouse for mouse movement events; which button and the type of click for mouse click events). A mouse uses an interrupt mechanism to report mouse operations to a computer system. It does not send a message directly to the program that is currently executing, but stores the sequential stream of events in a memory buffer and sends an interrupt request to the CPU. The currently executing program checks periodically to see whether a mouse event has occurred. On sensing an interrupt signal, the program reads the sequential stream of events from the buffer and acts accordingly.</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="488" height="336" alt="image" src="Image_392.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1244">Figure 6.5. </a><span class="s21">Simple operations to carry out various functions with a mouse.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Types of Mouse</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mouse devices are usually categorized as:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Mechanical and optical mouse. </b>A <i>mechanical mouse </i>has a ball that partially projects out through an opening in its base. The ball rolls due to surface friction when a user moves the mouse on a flat surface. On two sides of the ball (at 90<span class="s22">0 </span>angles from each other) are two small wheels that spin to match the speed of the ball. Each wheel of the mouse connects to a sensor. As the mouse ball rolls, the sensors detect how much each wheel spins and send this information to the computer in the form of changes to the current position of the graphics cursor on the screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An <i>optical mouse </i>has no mechanical parts like the ball and wheels. Instead, it has a built- in photo-detector. It comes with a special pad with gridlines printed on it. When a user moves the mouse on the pad, the photo-detector senses each horizontal and vertical line on the pad, and sends this information to the computer in the form of changes to the current position of the graphics cursor on the screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>One, two, and three buttons mouse. </b>A mouse can have one, two, or three buttons. A one-button mouse is good enough for programs designed to use only a single button. Some programs operate with a two-button or three-button mouse, but can still run on a system having fewer buttons by providing an alternative way to indicate a click of these buttons - such as by pressing shift key on keyboard while the mouse button is clicked. The leftmost button of a multi-button mouse is the main button that allows for most mouse operations because most people are right-handed and use their right index finger to click the main button. However, a user can configure another button as main button. For example, a left-handed user can configure the right-most button as main button.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1245">3. </a><b>Serial and bus mouse. </b>A <i>serial mouse </i>plugs into a normal serial port (a built-in socket in a computer&#39;s back panel to which we can connect external devices) of a computer, while a <i>bus mouse </i>requires a special electronic card, which provides a special port for connecting the mouse to a computer. The special electronic card fits into one of the expansion slots of the computer. Thus, a bus mouse occupies one of the expansion slots, whereas a serial mouse does not need any expansion slot.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Wired and cordless mouse. </b>A wired mouse connects to a computer with a small cord (wire), while a cordless mouse has no wired connection to a computer. It has a controller that communicates with the computer by transmitting a low-intensity radio or infrared signal. Although more expensive than a wired mouse, a cordless mouse allows easier movement of the mouse.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trackball</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part186.htm#bookmark1246" class="s23">A trackball is a pointing device similar to a mechanical mouse. Its roller ball is on the top (instead of the base) along with the buttons (see </a><a href="part186.htm#bookmark1246" class="s3">Figure </a>6.6<span class="p">). To move the graphics cursor on the screen, the user simply rolls the ball with hand (instead of moving the whole device). Hence, a trackball requires less space than a mouse for operation, and is often attached to or built into the keyboard. Trackballs are usually built into the keyboard of laptops, because laptop users do not always have a flat surface for moving the mouse.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Three shapes in which trackballs are commonly found in laptops are ball, button, and square. To move the graphics cursor at a desired position on the terminal screen, the user rolls the ball with fingers, or pushes the button with a finger, or moves a finger on the square platform.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Trackball is preferred for CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing) applications, because a designer can move the graphics cursor with hand movements only without moving the device, which suits the working style of designers working on large drawings.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Several equipment having embedded computers also use a trackball. For example, an Ultrasound machine usually has a trackball that a sinologist (medical expert in sonography) uses to move the cursor (usually in cross-hair shape) to mark the points of references on the image on the screen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Joystick</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part186.htm#bookmark1247" class="s23">A joystick is a pointing device that works on the same principle as a trackball. To make the movements of the spherical ball easier, it is placed in a socket with a stick mounted on it (see </a><a href="part186.htm#bookmark1247" class="s3">Figure </a>6.7<span class="p">). A user moves the stick forward or backward, left or right, to move and position the graphics cursor at a desired position. Most joysticks use potentiometers to sense stick and ball movements, and a click button on top of the stick to select the option pointed to by the cursor.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 134pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="282" height="144" alt="image" src="Image_393.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1246">Figure 6.6. </a><span class="s21">A trackball.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 145pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="252" height="178" alt="image" src="Image_394.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1247">Figure 6.7. </a><span class="s21">A joystick.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Typical uses of a joystick include video games, flight simulators, training simulators, and remote control of industrial robots.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1248">Electronic Pen</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An electronic pen is a pen-based point-and-draw device. Its two commonly used types are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Light pen. </b>It uses a photoelectric (light sensitive) cell and an optical lens assembled in a pen-shaped case. When a user moves the tip of the pen over the screen surface, the photoelectric cell and lens assembly detects the light emitted from a limited field of view of the screen&#39;s display. The system transmits this electric response to a processor, which identifies the menu item or icon that is triggering the photocell. In this manner, the graphics cursor locks on to the position of the pen and tracks its movement over the screen. The pen has a finger-operated button, which the user clicks to select an option from the screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A user can also draw on the screen with a light pen. For example, CAD applications allow users to use it with a keyboard to select different colors and line thickness, reduce/enlarge drawings, and add/erase graphics objects such as lines, circles, rectangles, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Writing pen with pad. </b>This type comes with a special writing pad. A user writes on the pad with the electronic pen the data to be input to the computer. With handwriting recognition software, this device enables input of text and freehand drawings into computer for word processing. Modern PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) provide this feature. Moreover, signatures and messages stored and transferred as graphic images are input with the use of this device. For example, delivery persons of goods delivery</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">organizations often use pocket computers with this device to accept recipients&#39; signatures against their names. The device captures the image of a signature and stores it in the computer for future references.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Touch Screen</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Touch screen enables a user to choose from available options by touching with a finger the desired icon or menu item displayed on a computer&#39;s screen, which has optical sensors to detect the touch of a finger. When a user touches the screen with a finger, the sensors communicate the position of touch to the computer, which interprets the input made by the user. Another type of touch screen uses a flat pad located beneath the screen, which has sensitive sensors to measure the pressure at many points. When a user touches the screen, the changing pressure allows the device to detect the location of touch, which it transmits to the computer as user&#39;s desired input.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Information kiosks often use touch screens. An <i>information kiosk </i>is an unattended system located at a public place that stores information of public interest and allows common people to access stored information as per their requirement. For example, information kiosks are often located at:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. An airport or a railway station to provide information to arriving passengers about hotels, restaurants, tourist spots, etc. in a city.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. In large museums or zoos to guide the visitors to locations of various attractions and facilities, and to caution them against things they are not supposed to do while inside.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. In a large bank, post office, or insurance company to introduce various types of services to customers, and to guide them to appropriate counters for their specific jobs. Bank ATMs also use them to enable customers to carry out their transactions easily.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. In environments having dirt or weather conditions, which prohibit use of keyboards and/or pointing devices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part185.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part187.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
