It is the database architecture for transaction processing. OLTP describes systems that support day-to-day business operations. These are transaction-processing systems, with many users concurrently accessing a database to insert, retrieve, update, and delete individual records. Hence, OLTP systems have efficient mechanisms for entry, retrieval, and update of individual pieces of data. However, they do not have mechanisms to support complex, large-scale data analysis.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, <i>OLAP </i>stands for <i>On-Line Analytical Processing</i>. It is the database architecture for effective data analysis. OLAP describes systems that integrate data from one or more systems, then aggregate and transform the data to support effective decision-making. OLAP systems use the concept of multi-dimensional databases and allow users to analyze the data using elaborate, multi-dimensional, complex views.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part425.htm#bookmark2102" class="s23">In short, OLAP helps an organization to decide what to do, and OLTP helps the organization to do it. </a>Figure 11.18<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">lists the differences between OLTP and OLAP systems.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="297" alt="image" src="Image_674.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2102">Figure 11.18. </a><span class="s21">Differences between OLTP and OLAP systems.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Data Mart</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A <i>data mart </i>is a subset of an organization&#39;s data warehouse. It contains data that is of value to a specific business unit or department of the organization, rather than the whole organization. It can contain both detailed and summarized data for each specific business area of an organization. A data mart captures data either from an organization&#39;s operational systems or from the organization&#39;s data warehouse. Users use a data mart to analyze data only for a single business area or department of an organization. Compare this with an organization&#39;s data warehouse, which users use to analyze data across multiple business areas or departments of the organization. An organization can build a data mart at a much lower cost, time, and effort than that involved in building a data warehouse. Because of their low cost and shorter development time, data marts start giving an early payback, thus justifying return of investment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2103">Metadata</a></h4><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Metadata <span class="p">is data about data. It is a catalog of information kept in a data warehouse. Typically, metadata of a data warehouse stores definitions of source data, target data, source to target mappings, transformation information, and update information. It is an integral part of a data warehouse, which exists along with the data warehouse.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drill-down and Roll-up Analyses</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An end user can extract and view information from a data warehouse as per his/her requirement. Depending on the nature of analysis that the end user wishes to carry out on the data, he/she can start viewing information from either the highest level (most coarse-grained information summary) to the lowest level (most fine-grained information details) or vice-versa. <i>Drill-down analysis </i>is the process of viewing information from a higher-level view to a lower level view. Conversely, <i>roll-up analysis </i>is the process of viewing information from a lower level up to a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">higher level.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For example, suppose there is a data warehouse containing citizen data for the whole country. A user can perform query analysis on the data warehouse to find the percentage of people area-wise in different occupations at city/village level, district level (each district comprising of several cities and villages), state level (each state comprising of several districts), and country level (the country comprising of several states). The user may perform drill-down analysis by starting the analysis at state level and gradually extracting this information for individual districts and cities/villages of interest. On the other hand, the user may perform roll-up analysis by starting the analysis at city/village level and gradually extracting aggregated information for districts, states, and the country.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ROLAP and MOLAP</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">OLAP systems support effective decision-making. Two popular architectures for OLAP systems to enable this are MOLAP (Multidimensional OLAP) and ROLAP (Relational OLAP). Although, analytical abilities and interfaces of these two architectures are the same, they differ in the way they store data physically. MOLAP stores data in a proprietary multidimensional database (MDDB), from which users can view the data in a multidimensional manner. On the other hand, ROLAP stores data in a conventional relational database and users use query languages (like SQL) to perform analysis on the data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Relative advantages and limitations of the two architectures are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Pre-identified queries are easier and faster to process with MOLAP than with ROLAP, because MOLAP can structure the multiple dimensions of a multidimensional database to handle such queries efficiently.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Since MOLAP stores the same data in multiple dimensions, storage space requirement is more for MOLAP than for ROLAP. Hence, MOLAP has a limit on the physical database size that it can handle. ROLAP is scalable to several terabytes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. MOLAP can handle a limited number of dimensions. ROLAP does not have any limit on the number of dimensions that it can handle.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. A proprietary multidimensional database is essential for implementation of MOLAP. ROLAP can use conventional relational database technology for its implementation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2104">Star and Snowflake Schemas</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Two commonly used schema models for designing data warehouses are star schema and snowflake schema. A data warehouse using <i>star schema </i><a href="part425.htm#bookmark2105" class="s23">model consists of one fact (major) table and many dimension (minor) tables. Fact table stores the primary keys for all dimension tables. </a><a href="part425.htm#bookmark2105" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">11.19</span> shows a simple example of a star schema. Here ‘sales’ is a fact table, whereas ‘customer’, ‘product’, ‘time’, and ‘store’ are dimension tables. The design appears like a star, with the fact table in the center, and radial linear connecting dimension tables to it. Main advantages of star schema are that it is easy to define, reduces the number of physical joins, and provides simple metadata.</p><p style="padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="285" height="87" alt="image" src="Image_675.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2105">Figure 11.19. </a><span class="s21">A sample star schema.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, a data warehouse using <i>snowflake schema </i><a href="part425.htm#bookmark2106" class="s23">model consists of normalized dimension tables by attribute level, with each smaller dimension table pointing to an appropriate aggregated fact table. Each dimension table has one key for each level of the dimension&#39;s hierarchy. The lowest key, for example, store key of store dimension will join store fact table, which will also have product and time keys. </a><a href="part425.htm#bookmark2106" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">11.20</span> shows an example of a snowflake schema. A practical way of designing a snowflake schema is to start with a star schema and create snowflakes with queries. Main advantage of snowflake schema is that it provides good performance for queries involving aggregation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="148" alt="image" src="Image_676.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2106">Figure 11.20. </a><span class="s21">A sample snowflake schema.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part424.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part426.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
