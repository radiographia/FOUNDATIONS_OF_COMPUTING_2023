However, quite often, a program uses a set of machine language or assembly language instructions repeatedly. For example, suppose we need three instructions, always in the same order, whenever we need to print a value. Instead of forcing a programmer to write the three instructions every time he/she wants to print a value, we might as well design the assembler (program) to substitute these three instructions for a single instruction, say PRINT. Every time the assembler encounters the PRINT instruction in a program, it would translate it into three machine language instructions instead of one, hence, supplying the complete set of instructions required for printing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Any instruction, such as PRINT, which an assembler translates into multiple machine language instructions, is called <i>macro instruction</i>. There might be many such macro instructions permitted by an assembler to speed up coding process.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The use of macro instructions adds more work to a computer because the assembler must be able to supply the missing instructions as well, but it means a tremendous saving of work for a programmer. The programmer is relieved of the task of writing an instruction for every machine operation performed. Hence, the use of macro instructions reduces the length of programs, cuts down on errors, and simplifies programming.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The macro instruction capability was developed early in the evolution of computer languages. In fact, it is this concept of multiple machine instructions from one macro instruction around which today&#39;s machine-independent, high-level languages are designed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part313.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part315.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
