A packet-filtering router examines each incoming/outgoing packet and then forwards/discards the packet based on a set of packet-filtering rules defined by the security policies. Filtering rules use information in an IP packet to implement such policies as:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a. Allow/disallow a packet based on its source IP address.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">b. Allow/disallow a packet based on its destination IP address.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">c. Allow/disallow a packet based on its source and destination port number (transport- level address), which defines applications such as SNMP or TELNET.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">d. Allow/disallow a packet based on its IP protocol field value (transport protocol).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Packet-filtering rules also define default action, which the packet-filtering router exercises when it does not find a direct rule match for a packet with any of the explicit packet- filtering rules. The two default policies are:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. <i>Default-deny. </i>This policy discards all packets, which explicitly defined rules do not permit. It is a conservative policy and requires addition of every rule on a case-to- case basis for permitting different types of packets. However, it provides increased security.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">b. <i>Default-permit. </i>This policy forwards all packets for which there are no explicitly defined rules. It is a liberal policy and has better ease of use for end users. However, it provides reduced security.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2589">2. </a><b>Proxy server. </b>A proxy server is a firewall that examines and filters application-layer traffic. It is also called <i>application-level gateway</i>. When a TCP/IP application (such as HTTP, FTP, or Telnet) on a host on one network tries to communicate with a remote host on another network, the proxy server asks the user to specify a valid user ID and authentication information for accessing the application on the remote host. The proxy server contacts the application on the remote host with this information. If the proxy server does not implement the proxy code for a specific application, the security policy does not support this application service. Hence, the proxy server does not forward requests for this application across the firewall. A network administrator can also configure a proxy server to support only specific features of an application that the security policy considers acceptable while denying all other features.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Proxy servers are more secure than packet-filtering routers because they only examine a few allowable applications. With proxy servers, it is also easy to log and audit all incoming traffic at application level.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Connection-establishment server. </b>A connection-establishment server is a firewall that establishes only permitted TCP connections between a user on the trusted network and a user on the untrusted network. It does not allow direct end-to-end TCP connection between two such users. Rather, it sets up two TCP connections, one between itself and a TCP user on the trusted network, and one between itself and a TCP user on the untrusted network. It finally connects the two TCP connections, if the security policy permits such a connection. Once the connection-establishment server establishes a connection (circuit) between the two TCP users, it relays TCP segments from one connection to the other without examining the contents. A connection-establishment server is also known as a <i>circuit-level gateway</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Network Address Translating (NATing) server. </b>NATing sever is a firewall that hides true IP addresses of critical hosts in the trusted network. Hosts protected by a firewall commonly use IP addresses in the “private address range”. Some of these hosts are critical and their security policy requires that the outside world should not know their IP addresses. In such a situation, an organization uses a NATing firewall, which uses a proxy IP address (known to the outside world) for such a host and translates the proxy IP address to the host&#39;s true IP address or vice-versa for all communications between the host and the outside world.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Note that the functionalities offered by different types of firewalls discussed above need not necessarily be on different physical machines. A properly configured single system can offer all these functionalities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part558.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part560.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
