This resulted in availability of large volumes of data in databases. With continuous use of databases for several years, database owners gradually accumulated large volumes of data in their databases. A question that all owners of such databases started facing is “What do we do with so much of gathered data? Should we discard several years old data and keep only the recent ones?” However, after some thought and analysis, they realized that they should not discard old data because it contains some valuable information. It contains an important, and largely ignored, resource - broad knowledge about their activities/businesses that could support better decision-making, if they exploit it properly. For instance, consider the following examples:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. If an owner of a scientific database analyzes data in his/her database properly, he/she can get useful observations about some phenomenon under study.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. If an owner of a business database analyzes data in his/her database properly, he/she can get useful information about critical markets, competitors, and customers.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2091">3. If an owner of a manufacturing database analyzes data in his/her database properly, he/she can get useful information about performance and optimization opportunities, as well as keys to improve processes and troubleshooting problems.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Traditional method of converting data into knowledge relied on manual analysis and interpretation. However, manual analysis of data gradually became impractical in many domains as data volumes grew exponentially. Furthermore, manual analysis of a dataset is slow, expensive, and highly subjective. When scale of data analysis grew beyond human capabilities, people started looking to computer technology to automate the process. Initially, this resulted in the use of statistical techniques on computers for automatic data analysis. Use of statistical techniques along with file management tools soon became ineffective for analysis of data in databases because of large size of modern databases, mission-critical nature of data, and need to produce analyses results quickly. These limitations of statistical techniques motivated researchers to look for new approaches of data analysis. Ultimately, they introduced a new generation of techniques and tools for automatic analysis of huge volumes of data. These techniques and tools for extraction of knowledge (useful information) from large datasets to help decision makers make meaningful decisions are the subject of the field called <i>data science</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part421.htm">Stages in Data Science</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part419.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part421.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
