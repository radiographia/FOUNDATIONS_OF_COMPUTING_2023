Each computer of this system has its own local memory and other peripheral devices. Communication between any two computers in this system takes place by passing messages over the communication network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Two types of operating systems used commonly for distributed computing systems are <i>network operating systems </i>and <i>distributed operating systems</i>. The three most important features used commonly to differentiate between these two types of operating systems are system image, autonomy, and fault tolerance capability:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>System image. </b>In case of a network operating system, users view a distributed computing system as a collection of distinct computer systems connected by a communication subsystem. That is, users are aware of the fact that the system has multiple computers. On the other hand, a distributed operating system hides the existence of multiple computers and provides a single-system image to its users. It makes a collection of networked computers appear to its users as a <i>virtual single system </i>by providing similar type of user interface as that of centralized operating systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Autonomy. </b>In a network operating system, each computer of a distributed computing system has its own local operating system (the operating systems of different computers may be the same or different). There is essentially no coordination among the computers except for the rule that when two processes of different computers communicate with each other, they must use a mutually agreed communication protocol. Each computer functions independently of other computers in the sense that each one makes independent decisions about the creation and termination of their own processes and management of local resources. Notice that due to the possibility of difference in local operating systems, the system calls for different computers of the same distributed computing system may be different in this case.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, in case of a distributed operating system, there is a single system-wide operating system and each computer of a distributed computing system runs a part of this global operating system. The distributed operating system tightly interweaves all the computers of the distributed computing system in the sense that they work in close cooperation with each other for efficient and effective utilization of various resources of the system. Hence, the distributed operating system manages processes and several resources globally (each computer system manages some resources locally). Moreover, there is a single set of globally valid system calls available on all computers of the distributed computing system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Fault tolerance capability. </b>A network operating system provides little or no fault tolerance capability in the sense that if 10% computers of a distributed computing system are down at any moment; at least 10% of users are unable to continue with their work. On the other hand, with a distributed operating system, most users are normally unaffected by the failed computers and can continue to perform their work normally, with only a 10% loss in performance of the distributed computing system. Therefore, the fault tolerance capability of a distributed operating system is usually high as compared to that of a network operating system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In short, both network operating systems and distributed operating systems deal with multiple computers interconnected together by a communication network. In case of a network operating system, users view the system as a collection of distinct computers, but in case of a distributed operating system, users view the system as a “virtual single system”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part396.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part398.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
