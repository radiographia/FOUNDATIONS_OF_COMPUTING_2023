Hence, when a data communication system uses an analog facility for data transmission between two digital devices (say two computers interconnected by a telephone line), it requires two modems, one near each device. As </a><a href="part440.htm#bookmark2192" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">12.9</span> shows, when sender&#39;s computer generates and sends digital signal, modulator of the modem placed near sender&#39;s computer converts it to analog form. The communication system then transmits this analog signal through telephone line upto the modem near receiver&#39;s computer. The demodulator of this modem then converts analog signal to digital form and passes on the digital data to receiver&#39;s computer. The receiver computer processes the data, and then the modulator of the modem near it modulates the processed data to analog form. The communication system returns this analog data through telephone line to the sender computer end, where the demodulator of the modem near it demodulates analog signals to digital form, and then passes the digital data to sender&#39;s computer. Hence, modem is an essential piece of hardware for any application in which two digital devices (say two computers) want to communicate over an analog transmission channel (say a telephone line).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When a user wants to use a modem, he/she should consider the following factors:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Transmission speed. </b>A modem having higher transmission speed can communicate faster. Transmission speeds of earlier modems were 300, 1200, or 2400 bps, whereas modern modems can operate at 9600, 14400, or 28800 bps.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To make modems of different manufacturers interoperable, Consultative Committee for International  Telephony  and  Telegraphy  (CCITT)  has  defined  standards  (called <i>modulation protocols</i>) for modems. The first such standard, called V.32, achieves</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">transmission speeds of 9600 bps. Another standard, called V.32bis (“bis” means in addition to), provides additional functionality to V.32 modems. It allows modems to exchange data at a rate of 14400 bps. A more recent standard, called V.34, allows modems to exchange data at a rate of 28800 bps.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Two modems can communicate with each other only if both follow the same modulation protocol. That is, even if a modem follows the V.34 protocol, it cannot communicate at 28800 bps unless the modem at the other end also follows the same protocol. To take care of this problem, most modems have <i>fall back </i>feature, which allows a fast modem to communicate with any slower modem. That is, when two modems attempt to establish a connection for communication, they try to establish which protocols they share, and then they use the fastest rate that both modems have. Hence, if two computers, one with 9600 bps modem, and the other one with 14400 bps modem, try to communicate, they can transfer data between them at 9600 bps only.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="168" alt="image" src="Image_709.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2192">Figure 12.9. </a><span class="s21">Illustrating the use of modems in data communications.</span><a name="bookmark2193">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Internal versus external. </b>An internal modem is an optional add-on circuit board that plugs into one of computer&#39;s expansion slots. It gets its power from computer&#39;s expansion bus. Computer manufacturers manufacture and supply such modems with their computers. An external modem, on the other hand, is a separate box containing circuitry and logic to modulate data signals. It has its own power supply, on/off switch, and front-panel LCDs to indicate its status. For this reason, external modems are more expensive. An external modem is connected to a computer via serial port.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Both internal and external modems connect to a telephone system with a standard telephone jack. Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Internal modems are faster and cheaper than external modems and are free of hanging external wires and power cords, which are present in case of external modems. However, a user can switch off an external modem independent of the computer, and can send it for repair/maintenance independent of the computer, in case of any problem with the modem.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Facsimile facility. </b>Some modems, known as <i>FAX modems</i>, can function as both a FAX machine and a modem. A computer with a FAX modem can send/receive text and images as a FAX to/from either a remote FAX machine or another computer with a FAX modem. FAX modems can be of external or internal type.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Error correction. </b>Data transmission errors may occur while data moves on telephone lines from one modem to another. Some modems use methods of recovering from data transmission errors. Two standard methods (protocols), which these modems use for error</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">correction feature are MNP4 (Microcom Network Protocol Version 4) developed by Microcom, Inc. and V.42 standard developed by CCITT. MNP4 error-correction protocol is suitable for low-speed modems (such as those operating at 2400 bps), whereas V.42 standard is suitable for higher-speed modems (those operating at 9600 bps and 14400 bps).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Data compression. </b>Data compression techniques help in reducing the volume of data. The amount of reduction depends on the kind of data and the compression algorithm used, but can be as high as 10:1 ratio. Modems with built-in data-compression techniques have higher throughput (can transfer more data in same amount of time) than conventional modems with same speed.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part440.htm#bookmark2194" class="s23">Keeping interoperability in mind, the two standard data compression techniques used in the design of modems are Microcom&#39;s MNP5 specification and CCITT&#39;s V.42bis specification. Normally, low-speed modems use MNP5 and high-speed modems use V.42bis. </a><a href="part440.htm#bookmark2194" class="s3">Figure </a>12.10<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows the effective throughputs of base data rates for the two standard specifications. Notice that MNP5 almost doubles the transmission rate of a modem, and V.42bis almost quadruples it. For data compression to work effectively, two communicating modems must support a common data-compression standard. Most modems can determine and adjust to the data compression capabilities of another modem automatically.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 175pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="215" height="126" alt="image" src="Image_710.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 193pt;text-indent: -131pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2194">Figure 12.10. </a><span class="s21">Effective throughputs of base data rates with the two standard data compression specifications used in modems.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2195">6. </a><b>Intelligence. </b>Some modems have microprocessors, storage chips, and specialized communication chips. A user can program such a modem to perform dialing, answering, and disconnecting functions automatically. For example, some modems can dial-up a remote computer automatically (auto-dial), and answer incoming calls from other computers (auto-answer). Similarly, some modems have <i>callback </i>feature that provides a security mechanism for protecting its computer from unauthorized access. They maintain a list of valid phone number and password combinations with routines for automatic password check and callback. When a remote computer tries to establish a connection with a computer having this type of modem, the modem immediately calls back the remote computer to ensure that it has indeed established connection with the authorized remote user. Modems having such features are called <i>smart modems </i>or <i>intelligent modems</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part439.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part441.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
