Hence, over the years, software industry has developed and used several tools that simplify the maintenance processes and increase the productivity of members involved in maintenance activities. Out of several tools that software maintenance personnel use, two of the most important ones are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Configuration management/version control tool. </b>Software developers use this tool to make changes to the correct files and to keep track of who is changing what parts of the source code. When multiple members of a development team work on the same software, it becomes a challenge to keep track of who is changing what parts of the source code. When the members of the development team are located in different locations (cities, countries, or even continents), the problem becomes compounded due to limited communication  among  the  remotely  located  developers.  The  version  control  or configuration management tool proves to be useful for development teams in such situations. It allows developers to check out code, make changes, and save both the old and new versions of the changed file(s). <i>Visual Source Safe (VSS) </i>from Microsoft, <i>ClearCase </i>by IBM Rational and <i>monotone </i>an Open Source tool are three examples of version control tool.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Bug reporting/tracking tool. </b>Software developers, testers, maintenance team members, and even the users (customers) use this tool to report bugs/problems in software along with information associated with a bug/problem. The development team also uses the tool to record the solution provided and associated information when they fix a reported bug/problem. In this manner, the tool helps in creating a knowledge repository of all known bugs/problems in software and the solutions provided for them. This knowledge repository is useful for support/maintenance team members in finding solutions to newly reported bugs/problems. BugZilla from the open source community is an example of bug reporting/tracking tool. JIRA is a commercial bug-tracking tool. Several major software vendors use their own in-house tool for this purpose.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part245.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part247.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
