In an AM technique, manufacturing material is combined/joined/added/glued together to create a 3D object. For example, a potter makes a pitcher using AM technique. To create a pitcher, he/she adds layers of mud, giving proper shape to each layer, while moving from bottom to top. This is contrary to <i>Subtractive Manufacturing  </i>(SM)  technique,  in  which  material  is  carefully removed/cut out/hollowed from a piece. For example, a sculptor often uses SM technique to carve out a statue from a single piece of stone/wood. As compared to SM techniques, AM techniques are generally cheaper because they enable manufacturing of objects having complex shapes with less material waste. 3D printers are gaining popularity because they automate the AM techniques of creating 3D objects, thus enabling creation of 3D objects in less time and at lower cost than manual AM techniques.</p><p style="padding-left: 203pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="98" height="172" alt="image" src="Image_425.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1308">Figure 6.36. </a><span class="s21">An example of an object printed by a 3D printer.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How 3D Printers Print 3D Objects?</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A 3D printer requires the following three steps to print a 3D object:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>First create a 3D digital file (3D model) of the object. </b>The first step is to create a 3D digital file of the object to be printed. For this, the user either uses a 3D modeling software to create a CAD (Computer Aided Design) file for the object, or uses a 3D scanner to create a 3D digital file of the object.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Then slice the 3D model into horizontal layers. </b>As the next step, the user uses a slicing software to slice the 3D model of the object into hundreds/thousands of thin horizontal layers (16 to 180 microns). Note that the 3D printer forms the 3D object by placing and gluing these layers one-by-one on top of each other in the right sequence. Slicing software often comes with a 3D printer, and the user should use the slicing software of the same 3D printer on which he/she is going to print the object.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Then upload the sliced file and print. </b>Finally, the user uploads the sliced file to the 3D printer by giving a print command to it. The 3D printer prints the object layer-by-layer by depositing and solidifying the manufacturing material used by the printer on top of an already printed layer. As soon as the printer completes depositing and solidifying the last layer of material, the printed 3D object is ready.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Types of 3D Printers</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All 3D printers use additive manufacturing technology. However, they mainly differ in the way they build an object layer-by-layer and the material they use for manufacturing objects. We describe here some commonly used 3D printing technologies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). </b>The method uses plastic/metal filament (wire) as the build material that melts when heated and quickly solidifies after extrusion (release) from a nozzle. The printer consists of a supply reel, which supplies material filament to an extrusion nozzle. The extrusion nozzle has a heating mechanism to melt the filament. It can move horizontally in both left and right directions under direct control of computer- aided manufacturing (CAM) software. To print an object, the printer releases the molten material from the nozzle on a specific path determined by the software, to create the first horizontal layer of the object on a build platform/tray located below the nozzle. The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1309">molten material instantly cools down and solidifies. The printer then lowers the build platform by a distance equal to the thickness of a layer, and again releases the molten material from the nozzle to form the next layer on top of the already built layer. The printer repeats this process until all layers are completed. In this manner, the printer creates the entire 3D object layer-by-layer. Color printers based on this technology use multiple supply reels (each having filament of different color) and multiple nozzles. The software takes care of releasing the right color of molten material from the appropriate nozzle to create a multi-color object.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>STereoLithography (STL) and Digital Light Processing (DLP). </b>Both the methods use photo-polymerization technique, which involves solidification of photosensitive resin (sticky substance) by means of a light source. 3D printers based on this technique use a vat (tub/tank) containing liquid (photosensitive polymer) resin as the build material. The printer sprays the liquid resin through a nozzle onto a build platform/tray in ultra-thin layers and uses a light source to solidify the liquid resin. SLA uses laser, while DLP uses traditional arc lamp as the source of light. The printer lowers the build platform by distance equal to the thickness of a layer, again sprays the liquid resin from the nozzle, and solidifies it using the light source, to form the next layer on top of the already built layer. The printer repeats this process until all layers are completed. In this manner, the printer creates the entire 3D object layer-by-layer. Color printers based on this technology use multiple vats (each having liquid resin of different color) and multiple nozzles. The software takes care of releasing the right color of liquid resin from the appropriate nozzle to create a multi-color object.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). </b>The method uses small particles of plastic, ceramic or glass in powder form as the build material. The printer uses high power laser to melt and fuse (sinter) these particles to create the desired 3D object. The printer spreads a thin layer of plastic/ceramic/glass powder onto a build platform/tray and selectively sinters the powder particles using a high power laser source, mapping the shape of the desired 3D object. The printer lowers the build platform by distance equal to the thickness of a layer, again spreads the powder particles, and selectively sinters the powder particles using the laser source, to form the next layer on top of the already built layer. The printer repeats this process until all layers are completed. In this manner, the printer creates the entire 3D object layer-by-layer. As the printer creates the 3D object layer-by-layer, excess un- melted powder acts as support for the 3D object and the printer finally removes it from the object and reuses it during the next printing cycle. 3D printers that use this method of printing, but use metal powder as the build material, instead of plastic/ceramic/glass powder, are called Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) printers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>A much faster, experimental 3D printing technique. </b>A team of scientists at the University of Michigan, USA is currently experimenting with a new STL-based 3D printing technique, which promises to print 3D objects at about 100 times the speed of other 3D printers based on current technologies. The technique uses a vat of specially engineered chemical resin along with Ultra Violet (UV) and blue LED lights, instead of laser beam. It prints a 3D object by sending UV light through a glass-bottomed vat of specially designed resin. Then, at the same time, through that same glass window, it sends patterns of bright and dim blue light. The specially engineered resin has the property that it hardens (polymerizes) when exposed to a particular shade of blue light, but does not harden in the presence of a certain wavelength of UV light. Hence, the technique uses UV</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">light inhibitor in conjunction with blue light to sculpt 3D surfaces and contours of hardened resin. It also uses it to prevent the hardened resin from sticking to the window. The team of scientists working on this technique claim that this is the first truly 3D printing technique in that it prints not just a series of single 2D layers, but rather entire 3D wedges of material in one pass.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3D printing technologies are still evolving with gradual addition of many new technologies to the list above. To choose a 3D printer based on a particular technology, a user needs to make his/her judgement based on function, material, budget and design parameters.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Applications of 3D Printers</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is faster and cheaper to manufacture many types of 3D objects by 3D printing method than by other manufacturing methods. By using 3D printing, it is also possible to create complex and customized designs with greater ease and cheaper cost as compared to other manufacturing methods, because no expensive tooling is required to create a new type of object through 3D printing method. Hence, many types of industries are now using 3D printing technologies as their preferred manufacturing method. We provide here a few such examples.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1310">1. </a><b>Rapid prototyping</b>. Manufacturers extensively use 3D printers in their design process to create prototype designs, before finalizing a design for mass production. They quickly print an object from its paper design, and if they do not like the design, they make instant changes to the design on the computer and re-print the revised prototype, saving enormous time and effort as compared to conventional methods of creating prototype designs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Rapid manufacturing of customized designs</b>. With 3D printing, manufacturers are allowing customers to place orders for products with customized designs. For example, customers can now order for decoration pieces of fancy designs and matching sizes, lighting fixtures and lamp shades of unique shapes/sizes/colors, chocolates/candies/cakes of fancy shapes and colors, ornaments/jewelry of fancy designs and colors, etc.; and suppliers can rapidly manufacture and deliver these products to customers by using 3D printers. This was not possible so easily with conventional methods of manufacturing.</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="530" height="475" alt="image" src="Image_426.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1311">Figure 6.37. </a><span class="s21">Schematic of FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1312">3. </a><b>Manufacturing body/engine parts</b>. Several types of industries use 3D printing for manufacturing body/engine parts. For example, car manufacturers manufacture parts of car body/engine, aircraft manufacturers manufacture parts of airplane body/engine; furniture manufacturers manufacture parts of assembled furniture; construction companies manufacture parts of assembled buildings; etc., by using 3D printers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Manufacturing implants and prosthetics</b>. In the medical world, implants and prosthetics (an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which might have been lost through accident, disease, or congenital conditions) need to be custom designed for each patient. Manufacturers of such implants and prosthetics are quickly manufacturing such designs by using 3D printers. Although, grown up people may use their prosthetic devices for long time, but children need to change their prosthetic devices periodically, as they grow. It is possible now to manufacture such prosthetic devices at affordable costs with 3D printing. Due to this, such patients around the world are experiencing improved quality of medical care, which was not available earlier.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Manufacturing hearing aid and dental appliances</b>. Just as implants and prosthetics, hearing aid and dental appliances (such as, braces, dentures, crowns, night guards, retainers, etc.) also need to be custom designed for each patient. Many dentists are now using 3D printers to manufacture such dental appliances in the exact shape and size that</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">their clients need at a fraction of the cost and time required earlier for making such appliances.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Manufacturing museum souvenirs</b>. Museums across the world are using 3D printers to manufacture miniature versions of objects kept in the museum for sale as museum souvenirs.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part196.htm#bookmark1311" class="s3">Figure </a>6.37<span class="p">. shows the schematic diagram of FDM technology.
