This sheet of film is called a <i>microfiche </i>(“fiche” is pronounced as “fish”. It is a French word that means card). COM recording process produces page images that are 48 or more times smaller than those produced by conventional printers. Hence, a single microfiche can hold about 300 times as much information as a standard computer printed page. A microfiche roll consists of several microfiche sheets.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">COM uses a <i>microfilm recorder </i>for recording output on a microfiche, and a <i>microfilm reader </i>to view recorded information. The microfilm recorder receives output from a computer system, which it displays page-by-page on to a screen. A high-speed camera (in-built into the system) then takes picture of the displayed information. In some systems, the recorder processes the film from the camera, while other systems use a separate automated film developer to produce filmed images of the output.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part197.htm#bookmark1314" class="s23">A user uses a microfilm reader (see </a><a href="part197.htm#bookmark1314" class="s3">Figure </a>6.38<span class="p">) to view the output recorded on a microfiche. It operates on a “back projection” principle and displays a frame (a single page of information) at a time on a translucent screen, whose size is about 8&quot;×11&quot;. A user reads the displayed information on the screen. Most microfilm readers also have a printer in-built into it (or attached to it) to allow a user to print selected pages for hard-copy output.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 191pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="130" height="139" alt="image" src="Image_427.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1314">Figure 6.38. </a><span class="s21">A microfilm reader.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1315">Most COM systems come with computer-assisted-retrieval software, which allows a user to search a document quickly from thousands of pages of recorded information on the film by specifying pre-assigned index terms.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As compared to a printer, a COM system has the following advantages and limitations:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Information recording speed is many times faster for a COM system as compared to a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">printer. A COM system is 20 to 25 times faster than an average line printer.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Microfilm output is many times more compact than a printed page output. A single microfiche can hold about 300 times as much information as a standard computer printed page. Thus, the mailing and storage costs of filmed documents are much less than paper documents.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Microfilm output is less costly than printed output. The cost of paper needed for printing a 1000 page document is about 20 to 30 times more than the cost of the film needed to record the same information.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. The initial investment required for installing a COM system is much more than that required for buying an ordinary printer. Hence, use of a COM system is justified only in case of high volume workload.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Many people feel uncomfortable using a COM system because of retrieval delays and lack of facility to write notes on margins of the reports.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A COM system provides an easy and compact way of recording and storing information, and retrieving a piece of information in a matter of seconds. It is ideal for use in applications that need to record and store large volume of information, and selectively retrieve them off-line. Organizations often need to maintain records of their various types of documents, such as catalogues, bills, invoices, etc., for a number of years before destroying them. A COM system is most suitable for this purpose. Insurance companies, banks, libraries, public utilities departments, government agencies, and many other types of organizations are regular users of COM systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part196.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part198.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
