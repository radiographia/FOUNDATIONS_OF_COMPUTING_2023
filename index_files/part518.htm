Some of these applications are as follows.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Video Games</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With the advent of multimedia, there has been a boom in different types of video games available on computer systems. Sound and animation help in making these games thrilling and exciting for users. Moreover, many of these games support high degree of interactivity, because they can change the sequence of events depending on the actions of a player.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2415">Virtual reality technology has enabled creation of new types of video games that was not possible before. For example, Virtual World Entertainment makes Battletech Center, in which players sit in a tiny booth and fight (play) a virtual battle with illusion of a real battle. A player can play (fight) either with the computer, or with a remote player over the network.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Special Effects in Movies</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Several movies now contain many computer-generated visual tricks. For example, the Hindi movie ‘Chachi 420’ uses computer graphics technique called morphing to show transformation of the hero from man to woman. The English movie, Jurassic Park shows dinosaurs as living creatures (although they no more exist) by using multimedia technology only. Similarly, a number of successful movies including Krrish, Bhoot, Titanic, Star Wars, Superman, and Spiderman have used multimedia technology for showing special effects.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Animation Films</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Computerized animation and coloring have given a new life to animation film industry. For conventional animation films, artists created animations by using hand-drawing technique, which was a tedious and time-consuming process. Because of hand drawing, quality of animations was also not good (was far from realistic). Using computer programs based on precise mathematical laws of physics, animators can now create animations that are far more realistic than before. Moreover, with computerized animation facility, an animator can now create in a few hours what an artist took days to create with hand-drawing techniques. Hence, an animator can now create elaborate scenes (such as the flying-carpet ride in Disney&#39;s <i>Alladin</i>) in much less time and cost than before.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smart/Interactive TV</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Interactive TV allows users to select TV programs of their choice from remote massive video</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">archives, view at the time they wish without leaving the comfort of their homes, and interact with the programs via user-interface functions, such as fast-forward and rewind. In essence, it implements a virtual video-rental shop from which customers can borrow and view videos of their choice at their own convenient time. The rental shop being virtual provides 24 hours service.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Interactive TV uses a Video-on-Demand (VoD) system and offers facilities such as movie-on- demand, news-on-demand, sports-on-demand, education-on-demand, etc., depending on which of these does the system support.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part518.htm#bookmark2416" class="s23">The main components of a VoD system are as follows (see </a>Figure 14.7<span class="p">):</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Video server. </b>A video server consists of massive storage and media controllers. It stores a large number of digitized videos, and on demand serves simultaneous requests to the same or different videos. Usually, its storage consists of magnetic disks, optical disks, and magnetic  tapes  in  hierarchical  organization  for  cost  effectiveness.  Under  this configuration, it stores popular videos on disks, and less popular ones on tapes. On demand, it retrieves a video from tape and brings it to disk for processing. Its basic functionalities include request handling, random access, and user interactions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Transport network. </b>Transport network delivers video programs from the video server to customers. It possesses high data transfer rate to meet real-time delivery requirement of video traffic.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Set-top box. </b>A customer uses a set-top box, a TV monitor, and an infrared controller (i.e., remote control) at his/her home (client-end premise). These devices enable the customer to connect to the video server, browse video selections, and interact with the video server via user-interface functions. Major functions of the set-top box include receiving of incoming video streams; demodulating, de-multiplexing, and decoding of signals; performing necessary signal conversion, such as D/A transformation for playback on TV monitor; and sending outgoing control messages.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="448" height="233" alt="image" src="Image_767.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2416">Figure 14.7. </a><span class="s21">A video-on-demand system.</span><a name="bookmark2417">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part517.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part519.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
