A vacuum tube [see </a><a href="part17.htm#bookmark657" class="s3">Figure </a>1.4<span class="p">(a)] was a fragile glass device using filaments as a source of electronics and could control and amplify electronic signals. It was the only high-speed electronic switching device available in those days. These vacuum tube computers could perform computations in milliseconds and were known as first- generation computers.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Most of the first-generation computers worked on the principle of storing program instructions</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">along with data in memory of computer (stored program concept) so that they could automatically execute a program without human intervention. Memory of these computers used electromagnetic relays, and users fed all data and instructions into the system using punched cards. Programmers wrote instructions in machine and assembly languages because of lack of high-level programming languages in those days. Since machine and assembly languages are difficult to work with, only a few specialists understood how to program these early computers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part15.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part17.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
