It makes the operation of a computer system more effective and efficient. It helps hardware components work together, and provides support for the development and execution of application software (programs). Good system software enables development and execution of application packages on a computer system with less time and effort. A computer without some kind of system software would be ineffective and most likely impossible to operate.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Programs included in a system software package are called <i>system programs</i>, and programmers who prepare system software are referred to as <i>system programmers</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some commonly known types of system software are operating systems, programming language  translators,  utility  programs,  performance  monitoring  software,  and communications software. They are described in subsequent chapters.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Application software. </b><i>Application software </i>is a set of one or more programs, which solves a specific problem, or does a specific task. For example, payroll processing software, examination results processing software, railway/airline reservation software, and computer games software are application software. Similarly, a program written by a scientist to solve a research problem is also application software.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Programs included in an application software package are called <i>application programs</i>, and programmers who prepare application software are referred to as <i>application programmers</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Today, millions of application software packages are available for a wide range of applications. They range from simple applications such as word processing, inventory management, preparation of tax returns, banking, hospital administration, insurance, publishing,  to  complex  scientific  and  engineering  applications  such  as  weather forecasting, space shuttle launching, oil and natural gas exploration, design of complex structures like aircrafts, ships, bridges, sky-rise buildings, etc. With so many applications available, it is not possible to categorize them all and to cover them here. Later in the chapter, we describe some commonly known application software.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part211.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part213.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
