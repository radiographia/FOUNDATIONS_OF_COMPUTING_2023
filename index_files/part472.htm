Such an arrangement, enables sharing of hardware and software resources, as well as information, among several users who may be far away from each other. Individual computers of a distributed computing system are referred to as </span>nodes<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Distributed computing systems are more complex and difficult to build than traditional centralized systems because:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">1. Their design must enable them to effectively use and manage a large number of distributed resources.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Their design must enable various nodes of the system to communicate with each other</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reliably. For this, they need special software to handle loss of messages during transmission across network, and to prevent overloading of network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Their design must include special security mechanisms to protect distributed shared resources and services against intentional or accidental security violations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2269">However, advantages of distributed computing systems outweigh their disadvantages. For example, some advantages of distributed computing systems are as follows:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Inherently  distributed  applications.  </b>Several  applications  require  a  distributed computing system for their realization. A few examples of such applications are electronic mail facility, on-line shopping, on-line banking, on-line reservation system, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Information sharing among distributed users. </b>In a distributed computing system, a user can generate information and share it with other users working at other nodes of the system. For example, two or more users who are geographically far apart, but whose computers are part of the same distributed computing system, can work on a project together. In this case, the users can work in cooperation, for example, by transferring files of the project, logging on to each other&#39;s remote computers to run programs, and exchanging messages by electronic mail to coordinate their work. Use of distributed computing systems by a group of users to work cooperatively is known as<i>computer- supported cooperative working </i>(CSCW), or <i>groupware</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Resource sharing. </b>Information is not the only thing that users of a distributed computing system can share. They can also share software resources (such as software libraries and databases) and hardware resources (such as processors, printers, hard disks, and plotters).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Better price-performance ratio. </b>Distributed computing systems potentially have much better price-performance ratio than a single large centralized system because they facilitate resource sharing among multiple computers. For example, all computers of a LAN-based distributed computing system can share a single unit of expensive peripheral devices such as color laser printers, high-speed storage devices, and plotters. If these computers are independent stand-alone systems (not part of a communication network), each computer will require a separate unit of each of these peripherals, resulting in higher cost.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Shorter response times and higher throughput. </b>A distributed computing system provides shorter response times and higher throughput than a single centralized system because it has multiple computers, which can work together to process more jobs in less time. For example, if a programmer can partition a computation into a number of sub- computations that can run concurrently, a distributed computing system can run all sub- computations simultaneously with each one on a different computer. <i>Parallel processing systems </i>(a type of distributed computing system) use multiple computers interconnected with fast communication networks to solve single complex problems rapidly. Another method often used in distributed computing systems for achieving better overall performance is to distribute the load more evenly among multiple computers by moving jobs from currently overloaded ones to lightly loaded ones.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Higher reliability. </b>A reliable system prevents loss of information even in the event of component failures. Multiplicity of storage devices and computers in a distributed computing system allows maintenance of multiple copies of critical information within</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the system, and execution of important computations redundantly to protect them against catastrophic failures. With this approach, if one of the computers fails, the system can complete the computation on another computer. Similarly, if one of the storage devices fails, the system can still use some information from another storage device having a copy of the information.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. <b>Extensibility and incremental growth. </b>It is possible to extend the power and functionality of a distributed computing system gradually by adding additional resources (both hardware and software) to the system, as and when need arises. For example, an organization can add additional processors to its distributed computing system to handle increased workload that might have resulted from its expansion. Incremental growth is an attractive feature, because for most existing and proposed applications, it is practically impossible to predict future demands of the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. <b>Better flexibility in meeting users&#39; needs. </b>Usually, different types of computers are more suitable for performing different types of computations. For example, computers with ordinary power are suitable for ordinary data processing jobs, whereas high-performance computers are more suitable for complex mathematical computations. In a centralized system, users have to perform all types of computations on the only available computer. However, a distributed computing system may have a pool of different types of computers, in which case, a user can select the most appropriate one for processing a job, depending on the nature of the job.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part471.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part473.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
