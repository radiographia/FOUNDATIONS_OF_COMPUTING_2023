Basic objective of the creators of such software is to popularize their software to as many users as possible. Users are encouraged to copy such software and try them out. Usually, the creators share the software freely with other users. Hence, we also refer to public-domain software as</span>shareware/freeware. <span class="p">They are also known as </span>community-supported software <span class="p">as mostly the authors do not support the product directly and users of the software support and help each other. While some shareware software remain full- featured and free perpetually, some other have to be bought to use all features (such partial packages are referred to as </span>Lite/Free/Personal edition <span class="p">) or after some use (referred to as </span>trial period<span class="p">).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another  type  of  public-domain  software  becoming  popular  among  users,  and  fellow programmers equally, are those that come with their source code. We refer to such software as <i>Open Source Software (OSS)</i>. Usually, open source software allows a user to download, view, modify, and distribute modified source code to others. There are special licensing systems for open source software and their source code. They promote open source movement and protect</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the copyright of original and subsequent authors of open source software. General Public License (GPL) of GNU organization and BSD License from Berkeley Software Division of University of California are some of the most popular licensing systems in place and used world over.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Not all open source software is necessarily free, and not all free software is necessarily open source.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If a user finds a public-domain software suitable for his/her requirements, he/she can obtain it by downloading it from the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Following are the advantages and limitations of downloading and using public-domain software packages:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. Usually, they are free and accompanied with their source code.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. A user can download and use them immediately. The user need not wait to start the planned activity until a team develops the required software.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Normally, the creators of OSS do not test the software properly before release, and their support is poor as compared to commercial software. Hence, OSS may fail during operation, and even if a user reports a bug, the creators may not fix it soon.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part219.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part221.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
