As the name implies, users use PCs for their personal computing needs (such as professional work, personal work, education, and entertainment) either at their work places or at their homes. Hence, PCs can be found in offices, classrooms, homes, hospitals, shops, clinics, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A PC has several chips (CPU chip, RAM chips, ROM chips, I/O handling chips, etc.) neatly assembled on a main circuit board called <i>system board </i>or <i>motherboard</i>. Motherboard is what distinguishes one PC from another. Sometimes, we differentiate between two PCs based on the microprocessor chip used as CPU. Most modern PCs use microprocessor chips manufactured by Intel, AMD (Advanced Micro Devices), or Apple.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part23.htm#bookmark669" class="s23">System configuration of PCs varies depending on their usage. However, the most commonly used configuration consists of a system unit, a monitor (display screen), a keyboard, and a mouse (see </a><a href="part23.htm#bookmark669" class="s3">Figure </a>1.7<span class="p">) System unit, in the form of a box, consists of main circuit board (consisting of CPU, memory, etc.), hard disk storage, any special add-on cards (such as network interface card), and ports for connecting peripheral devices such as printer, pen drive, portable disk, etc.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 140pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="266" height="214" alt="image" src="Image_062.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark669">Figure 1.7. </a><span class="s21">A personal computer (PC).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">System unit of a PC has <i>expansion slots </i>where we can plug in a wide variety of special-function <i>add-on boards </i>(also called <i>add-on cards</i>). These add-on boards contain electronic circuitry for a wide variety of computer-related functions. Number of available expansion slots varies from computer to computer. Some popular add-on boards are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. <b>Network Interface Card (NIC). </b>It enables connecting a PC to a network. For example, a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">user needs an Ethernet card to connect his/her PC to an Ethernet LAN.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Fax modem card. </b>It enables transferring of images of hard-copy documents from a PC to a remote computer via telephone lines just as we do using a fax (facsimile) machine.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Color and graphics adapter card. </b>It enables interfacing a PC with graphics and/or color video monitor. For example, a user needs a VGA (video graphics array) card to interface his/her PC with a high-resolution monitor.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Motion video card. </b>It enables integration of full-motion color video/audio with other output on monitor&#39;s screen. Since it accepts multiple inputs, videos can be shown full- screen (one video input) or in windows (multiple video inputs).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">System unit of a PC also has I/O ports (both serial and parallel ports) for connecting external I/O or storage devices (such as a printer and other devices external to the system unit box) to the PC in much the same way as you plug electric equipment into an electrical socket.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark670">Popular operating systems for PCs are MS-DOS, MS-Windows (comprising Windows XP, Vista), Linux, and UNIX. Apple&#39;s Macintosh PCs run Apple&#39;s propriety OS called Macintosh OS or Mac OS. These operating systems support </a><i>multitasking </i>enabling a user to switch between tasks.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PCs generally cost from a few tens of thousands to about a lakh of rupees, depending on configuration. Some major PC manufacturers are Lenovo, Apple, Dell, HCL, Siemens, Toshiba, and Hewlett-Packard.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part22.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part24.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
