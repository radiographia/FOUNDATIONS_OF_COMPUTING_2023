We measure it as the number of jobs (processes) completed by the system per unit time. For example, if a system is able to complete <i>n </i>processes in <i>t </i>seconds, its throughput is <i>n/t </i>processes per second during that interval. Throughput is normally measured in processes/hour. Note that the throughput of a system does not depend on its jobs processing efficiency only, but also on the nature of jobs processed. For long processes, throughput of a system may be one process/hour; whereas for short processes, it may be 100 processes/hour for the same system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Turnaround time. </b>From the point of view of an individual user, an important criterion is how long it takes a system to complete a job submitted by him/her. <i>Turnaround time </i>is the interval between the time of submission of a job to the system for processing and the time of completion of the job. Although, higher throughput is desirable from the point of view of overall system performance, individual users are more interested in better turnaround time for their jobs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Response time. </b>Turnaround time is not a suitable measure for interactive systems because in such a system, a process can produce some output early during its execution and can</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">continue executing while previous results are being output to the user. Hence, another measure used in case of interactive systems is <i>response time</i>. It is the interval between the time of submission of a job to the system for processing and the time of first response from the system for the job.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In any computer system, it is desirable to maximize throughput and minimize turnaround time and response time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part346.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part348.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
