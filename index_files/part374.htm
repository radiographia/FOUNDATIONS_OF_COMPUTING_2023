Commands supported by command interpretation module are known as <i>system calls</i>. When a user gives instructions to a computer by using these system calls, command interpreter interprets these commands and directs the computer&#39;s resources to handle the user&#39;s request. Hence, command interpreter provides a user interface to hide hardware details of a system from its users. In this manner, it contributes greatly to the ‘ease of use’ objective of an operating system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Modern operating systems support the following two broad categories of user interfaces:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Command-line interface. </b>Users give instructions to computers by typing commands in this textual user interface. For example, in UNIX, a user has to type “<i>rm report.txt</i>” to delete (remove) a file named <i>report.txt</i>. If a user types a command incorrectly, command interpreter responds with a message indicating that it did not understand the command. When this happens, the user has to retype the command correctly.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is no problem in typing simple commands like the one above. However, users often need to give detail instructions to computers about their jobs. For example, while submitting a job for execution, a user may need to supply the following information:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a. His/her identification for security and accounting purposes.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">b. Software and hardware resource requirements of the job.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">c. I/O device requirements of the job.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">d. Directories that contain the data files, which the job will use during execution.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">e. Action that the system needs to take in exceptional conditions, such as when the input data is missing or incorrect, or when an I/O device malfunctions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1956">To facilitate this, systems that support command-line interface, also support some type of </a><i>command language </i>(CL) or <i>job-control language </i>(JCL). Users can write codes in JCL to give detail instructions to computers about their jobs. Command interpreters interpret codes written in JCL and invoke appropriate system actions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Graphical user interface. </b>User interface plays an important role in ease of use of a computer system. An intuitive user interface allows a user to use the system effectively even if he/she has never used it before. Such a user interface is called <i>user friendly</i>. <i>Graphical user interface </i>or GUI (pronounced “gooey”) is easier to learn and use than command-line interface. Unlike command-line interface in which commands are textual, GUI commands are graphical (pictorial). GUI provides a screen full of graphic icons (small images on the screen) or menus, and allows a user to make rapid selection from these icons or menu items to give instructions to computers. A user uses a point-and-draw device to point to and select a graphic icon or menu item from multiple options on the screen. For example, in case of command-line interface, to delete a file <i>report.txt</i>, a user needs to type a command like “ <i>rm report.txt</i>”. However, with GUI, the user can perform the same operation by using a mouse to drag the icon, which represents the file to superimpose it on an icon having shape like a trashcan. Then releasing the mouse button causes the file to disappear into the bulging trashcan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part375.htm">Shell</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part373.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part375.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
