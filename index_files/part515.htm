For jerk-free full motion video, the display device must display 25 to 30 frames per second. Like animation, video is also an important component of multimedia applications, because it is useful for illustrating the concepts that involve movement. Although, both animation and video deal with display of a sequence of images (frames) to generate an effect of motion, video deals with recording of real-life events with a video-recording device such as a digital video recorder. Like animation data, video data also requires large storage space and needs to meet real-time</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2404">constraints on retrieval, delivery, and display. Hence, multimedia computer systems use digital video compression techniques to reduce storage requirement for storing video data.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Analog and Digital Video</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part514.htm#bookmark2399" class="s23">Video information travels in natural medium in the form of light waves that are analog in nature. To enable a computer to deal with video information, a device must convert light waves from analog to digital form. Video camera is a transducer that converts light waves to electrical signals, and monitor is a transducer that converts electrical signals to light waves. Like audio, in case of video also, A/D and D/A converters perform transformations between analog and digital video signals (see </a><a href="part514.htm#bookmark2399" class="s3">Figure </a>14.2<a href="part514.htm#bookmark2401" class="s23">). Analog-to-digital conversion of video also involves sampling and quantization of analog video signals (see </a><a href="part514.htm#bookmark2401" class="s3">Figure </a>14.3<span class="p">). A multimedia computer system capable of processing video data requires a video board (or video card) with A/D and D/A converters</span><span class="s15">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Video Display Technologies</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part512.htm#bookmark2392" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">14.1</span> shows the composition of an image as a collection of pixels, and its representation as a two-dimensional matrix. Each pixel is of the size of a small dot. Hence, designers of video display devices consider an image to be a set of horizontal lines, each a row of individual dots (pixels). To paint an entire video image on a monitor screen, an electron gun illuminates every pixel as it sweeps across the screen, one line at a time, from left to right and from top to bottom, and then back to the top. This process, called<i>raster scanning</i>, repeats several times every second (called <i>refresh rate</i>) to provide continuity of motion and avoid flicker.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A complete line, which the electron gun traces from left to right, is called a <i>scan-line</i>. In one pass of raster scanning, if the electron beams travel all scan-lines sequentially from top to bottom, it is called a <i>progressive scan </i><a href="part515.htm#bookmark2405" class="s23">[see </a><a href="part515.htm#bookmark2405" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">14.4</span>(a)]. On the other hand, if the electron beams travel only odd scan-lines in one pass and even scan-lines in the next pass, it is called an <i>interlaced scan </i><a href="part515.htm#bookmark2405" class="s23">[see </a><a href="part515.htm#bookmark2405" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">14.4</span>(b)]. For interlaced scan, each pass is called a <i>field</i>, and two complete fields comprise a full display screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When the electron beam reaches the end of the bottom-most scan-line, it retraces back to the top. Similarly, when the electron beam reaches the end of a scan-line, it retraces back to the beginning of the next scan-line that it has to trace. To prevent the retrace lines from being visible on the screen, the device applies blanking pulses to the picture tube. The time for the electron gun to move from the end of the bottom-most scan-line to the beginning of the top-most scan- line is called the <i>vertical blanking interval</i>, while the time for it to move from the right end of a scan-line to the left end of the next scan-line is called the <i>horizontal blanking interval</i>. The device often uses vertical blanking intervals to embed other signals, such as synchronization information, in broadcast television (TV) systems.</p><p style="padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="182" alt="image" src="Image_763.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2405">Figure 14.4. </a><span class="s21">Raster scanning techniques.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The two commonly used types of monitors for video display are TV monitors and computer monitors. <i>TV monitors </i>use interlaced scanning technique with a refresh rate of 60 fields per second or 30 frames per second (the actual refresh rate depends on which broadcasting standard the TV system uses - NTSC, PAL or SECAM). On the other hand, <i>computer monitors </i>use progressive scanning technique with a refresh rate of 60 frames per second. The <i>aspect ratio</i>, which is the ratio of horizontal to vertical dimensions, is 4:3 for both TV and computer monitors. Note that as compared to a computer monitor, a TV monitor costs less but often flickers due to lower refresh rate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2406">Types of Video Signals</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part512.htm#bookmark2392" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">14.1</span> shows the composition of a pixel as <i>RGB </i>components. Human vision is more sensitive to variation in <i>luminance </i>(brightness) than in <i>chrominance </i>(color difference). To take advantage of such deficiencies in human vision, researchers proposed the idea of separating light into luminance and chrominance components instead of RGB components. For example, YUV model separates luminance from chrominance via following linear transformation from RGB system:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">Y = 0.30R + 0.59G + 0.11B U = 0.62R - 0.52G - 0.10B V = - 0.15R - 0.29G + 0.44B</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Where <i>Y </i>is the luminance component and (<i>U, V</i>) are the chrominance components.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Based on these concepts of light representation, there are the following two types of video signals (for both analog and digital videos) for storage and transmission:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Composite video signals. </b>A composite video signal combines luminance <i>Y </i>and chrominance <i>C </i>into a single stream, which users can store or transmit. Examples of analog videos, which use composite video signals, include broadcast TV signals and VHS. Examples of digital videos, which use composite video signals, include D-2 and D-3 formats.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Component video signals. </b>A component video signal separates video into luminance <i>Y </i>and chrominance <i>C </i>streams. Component video signals are again of two types - <i>Y/C </i>component and <i>RGB </i>component<i>. Y/C </i>component uses two separate channels to transport <i>Y </i>and <i>C </i>information, whereas <i>RGB </i>component uses three channels to carry <i>R</i>, <i>G</i>, and <i>B</i></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">colors. Examples of analog videos, which use component video signals, include Hi8 (it is of <i>Y/C </i>component type) and Beta SP (it is of <i>RGB </i>component type). Examples of digital videos, which use component video signals, include D-1, D-4, and D-5 formats.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Out of the two, component video signals have better quality than composite video signals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Broadcast Television Standards</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The three main TV broadcasting standards are NTSC, PAL, and SECAM. All three are analog videos using composite video signals technology. They mainly differ in the way they encode chrominance signal. They also differ in screen resolution and frame rate. Their main characteristic features are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>NTSC. </b>NTSC stands for National Television Systems Committee. It is a system having 525 scan-lines. It uses interlaced scanning technique with a refresh rate of 29.97 frames per second. In NTSC, luminance signal is called <i>Y </i>signal, and chrominance signal is amplitude modulated onto the color subcarrier at two different phases - <i>I </i>(in-phase) value at 0<span class="s22">0 </span>and Q (quadrature) value at 90<span class="s22">0</span>. The USA, Japan, and some Asian countries use NTSC.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>PAL. </b>PAL stands for Phase Alternating Line. It is a system having 625 scan-lines. It uses interlaced scanning technique with a refresh rate of 25 frames per second. In PAL, composite video signal operates on <i>YUV </i>model, where <i>Y </i>is luminance component and (<i>U, V</i>) are chrominance components. PAL also transmits chrominance signal on a two-phase amplitude-modulated color subcarrier, but it uses a more complex process called Phase Alternating Line, which provides more bandwidth for chrominance modulation, yielding better color resolution. India and Western Europe (except France) use PAL.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2407">3. </a><b>SECAM. </b>SECAM was developed in France. It stands for Sequential Couleur Avec Memoire. It is a system having 625 scan-lines. It uses interlaced scanning technique with a refresh rate of 25 frames per second. SECAM transmits chrominance signal using a frequency-modulated color subcarrier, transmitting one of the color difference signals on every other scan-line, and the other color difference signal on alternate scan-lines. It has better color resolution than NTSC. France, Eastern Europe, Russia, and Middle East use SECAM.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part515.htm#bookmark2408" class="s3">Figure </a>14.5<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">summarizes the characteristic features of the three analog TV signal standards.

The two major broadcasting systems for commercial use of HDTV technology are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.

Museums, film production, teaching, electronic billboards, and multimedia games are some such applications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2410">Hardware Requirements for Video</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Normally, modern computers use the following hardware devices for video processing capability:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. A video camera as input device for capturing video data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. A video monitor (TV or computer monitor) as output device for displaying video data.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. A video board (or video card) with A/D and D/A converters, and connectors for video camera and video monitor. Video camera, video monitor, and video board must be compatible with each other.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Video editors to cut and paste video sequences, add special effects, and create new video sequences from existing video sequences. They also enable superimposing of text and audio on a video sequence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Software Requirements for Video</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following software capabilities are desirable in a multimedia computer system with video facility:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Video clips. </b>It is a library of video clips. A user can directly import a video clip from this library for use in a multimedia application. This saves lot of time and effort that the user might require otherwise to create or search a similar video clip. A video clips library often provides facilities to add a new video clip or delete an existing video clip from the library.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Recording and playback capability. </b>It enables users to control the recording and display of a video sequence. For example, it provides options to ‘pause’ and ‘replay’ a video sequence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part514.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part516.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
