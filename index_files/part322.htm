Hence, researchers have been continuously working towards developing better and better programming languages to make programming simpler, easier, and faster. The goal of the designers of every new programming language was to introduce some aspects or concepts in their programming language that will help to achieve the above-mentioned  objectives.  <i>Object-Oriented  Programming  </i>(often  referred  to  as  OOP, pronounced “oop”) is one such concept used in programming languages. Developers of Simula- 67 programming language first introduced the concept of OOP in 1967. This concept started gaining popularity in 1980s with the development of another programming language named Smalltalk that made extensive use of this concept. Starting in mid-1980s, OOP became a popular term and object-oriented dialects of existing programming languages (like Object-Pascal, Objective C, and C++) started appearing. Subsequently, C++ became a popular object-oriented programming language because of its connection with C and its support by AT&amp;T Bell Labs. Almost all popular programming languages (including Visual Basic and Java) now use OOP philosophy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1751">The basic idea behind OOP is that we use programming languages for simulating real-world problems on computers. Since much of the real world is made of objects, a simulation of such a world must include simulated objects. Hence, the essence of OOP is to solve a problem by identifying the real-world objects of the problem and the processing required of those objects, and then creating simulations of those objects, their processes, and the required communications between the objects.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part321.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part323.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
