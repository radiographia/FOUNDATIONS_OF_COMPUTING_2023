Many authors do not distinguish between multiprogramming and multitasking because both refer to the same concept of a system&#39;s capability to work concurrently on more than one task (job or process). Whenever a task (job or process) needs to perform I/O operations, the system uses its CPU for executing some other task (job or process) that is also residing in the system and is ready to use the CPU. However, some authors prefer to use the term <i>multiprogramming </i>for multi-user systems (multiple users can use such a system simultaneously, such as a mainframe system or a server class system), and <i>multitasking </i>for single-user systems (only one user uses such a system at a time, such as a personal computer or a notebook computer). Note that even in a single-user system, the system often processes multiple tasks at a time. For example, a personal computer user can execute a sorting job in background, while editing a file in foreground. Similarly, a personal computer user may be reading his/her electronic mail in foreground, while compilation of a program is in progress in background. In this manner, a user may work concurrently on many tasks. In a multitasking system, the user can partition the computer&#39;s display screen into multiple windows, and can view the status of different tasks on different windows.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multitasking eases user operation and saves lots of time when a user has to switch between two or more applications while performing a job. For example, let us assume that a user is using a word processor to create an annual report and he/she needs to do some arithmetic calculations for including calculated results in the report. Without multitasking, the user would have to close the annual report file and word processing application, open calculator application, make necessary calculations, write down the results, close calculator application, reopen word processing application with annual report file, and embed calculation results in it. With multitasking, the user simply opens calculator application while working on annual report file creation, makes necessary calculations, and switches back to the annual report file to continue working on it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hence, for those who like to differentiate between multiprogramming and multitasking, <i>multiprogramming </i>is interleaved execution of multiple jobs (of same or different users) in a multi-user system, while <i>multitasking </i>is interleaved execution of multiple jobs (often referred to as <i>tasks </i>of same user) in a single-user system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part350.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part352.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
