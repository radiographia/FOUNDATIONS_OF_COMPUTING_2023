To address this requirement, they need more dynamic ways</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to  link  people  and  information  than  conventional  means  of  communication.  Several organizations use Intranets to fulfill this requirement. An <i>Intranet </i>is a network that connects the computers and networks of an organization by using similar hardware and software, as those on the Internet. Typically, it uses TCP/IP protocols, browser software, and software for servers on the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With an Intranet, basic services of the Internet (electronic mail, file transfer protocol, telnet, and usenet news) become available to the employees and business partners of the organization. This allows them to communicate effectively and quickly by using electronic mail facility, and to share information, software, and other computing resources by using other facilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Various departments of the organization can upload their information on the organization&#39;s Intranet server, and all interested parties can access the information, read it, and download it without wasting paper to copy it, or time to make and circulate the copies. Similarly, employees of various offices of the organization located across the world can form a newsgroup to brainstorm or exchange ideas collectively on topics of common interest.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Since an Intranet involves only the computers and networks of an organization, it confines information on the Intranet only to the employees and business partners of the organization. This is a great security advantage of an Intranet. Furthermore, since an Intranet uses the same software as the Internet, which most computer users are already familiar with, users of the Intranet do not require any additional training. Due to these features, usage of Intranet is growing rapidly in many organizations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part496.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part498.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
