Password-based authentication of a user is an example of proof by knowledge. Authentication methods using proof-by-knowledge approach are of two types - direct-demonstration method and challenge-response method. In <i>direct-demonstration </i>method, a user claims his/her identity by supplying information (like typing a password) that the verifier checks against pre-stored information. On the other hand, in <i>challenge-response </i>method, a user proves his/her identity by responding correctly to challenge questions asked by the verifier. For instance, when signing up as a user, the user picks a function, for example, <i>x </i>+ 18. When the user logs in, the system selects and displays a number randomly, say 105, in which case the user must type 123 for authentication to be successful. For further security improvement, the same user may use several functions. At the time of login, the system uses one of the functions depending on login time. For example, a user may use seven different functions, one for each day of the week. In another variation of this method, the system maintains a list of questions such as what is the name of your father, what is the name of your mother, what is the name of your street on which your house is located. When signing up as a user, the user has to reply to all these questions and the system stores the answers. At login, the system asks one of these questions at random and verifies the answer supplied by the user.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2548">2. </a><b>Proof by possession. </b>In this approach, a user proves his/her identity by producing some item that only an authorized principal can possess. The system verifies the produced item to confirm the user&#39;s identity. For example, a system may require its users to produce a plastic card with an embedded chip that has a user identifier number stored in it in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">invisible, electronic form. A user inserts the card in a slot meant for this purpose in the system&#39;s terminal, which then extracts the user identifier number from the card and checks to see if the card produced belongs to an authorized user. Obviously, the system can ensure security only if the item to be produced is unforgeable and guarded safely.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Proof by property. </b>In this approach, the system verifies the identity of a user by measuring some physical characteristic of the user that is hard to forge. The characteristic must be distinguishing, that is, unique among all possible users. For example, a system may have a special device (known as a <i>biometric device</i>) attached to it for verifying some physical characteristic of a user, such as person&#39;s appearance, fingerprint, hand geometry, voice, or signature. While deciding the physical characteristic, system designers must consider psychological acceptance of the scheme to user community. Biometric systems offer the greatest degree of confidence that a user actually is who he/she claims to be. However, sometimes they have user acceptance problems because users see biometric devices as unduly intrusive.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In practice, a system may use a combination of two or more of these authentication methods. For example, bank ATMs usually employ a combination of the first two approaches. They allow a user to withdraw money only if he/she produces a valid identification card and specifies the correct password (PIN).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part545.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part547.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
