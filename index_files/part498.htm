If the organization connects all these computers to the Internet directly, maintaining security becomes difficult for the organization because the Internet is an open environment. There may be virus attacks on organization&#39;s computing resources and other security problems through the Internet. To deal with this problem, an organization often uses a <i>proxy server</i>, which is a specially configured computer, which allows other computers of the organization to interact with the Internet through it. When only a single proxy server interacts with the Internet, the organization can easily maintain the security of its computing resources, because it can keep the single proxy server more secure than hundreds of individual computers on a network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With proxy server, a user (employee) accesses the Internet from within the organization in the following manner. The user specifies the URL of a server on the Internet using the browser on his/her computer. The user&#39;s system sends the request to the proxy server, which then contacts the server on the Internet to obtain the requested information. The proxy server then sends the information received from the Internet server to the user&#39;s computer. All this is transparent to the user. That is, the user gets a feeling that he/she is accessing the Internet server directly. By acting as an in-between system, the proxy server can maintain security as well as log of all traffic between the Internet and the organization&#39;s network of computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Typically, an organization uses a proxy server for one or more of the following services:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>To serve as a firewall. </b>A <i>firewall </i>controls flow of messages to/from an organization from/to the Internet (outside world) for providing better security to the organization. For example, an organization can configure its firewall software running on proxy server for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">packet filtering to ensure that the firewall permits only certain packets to flow from inside the organization to outside world, or vice-versa. Similarly, the organization can configure its firewall software to allow telnet to a computer within the organization only from those computers of the outside world, whose IP addresses have been pre-registered in the proxy server. Many firewalls also permit establishment of port filters on a per host or subnet basis, allowing the network administrator to control access on a fine grained basis than just the whole organization.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>To log the Internet traffic. </b>An organization can configure its proxy server to log every IP address, date and time of access, URL, number of bytes downloaded, and so on. It can use this information to analyze any attacks against the organization&#39;s systems. It can also use this information to analyze which employee spends how much time on the Internet and what types of information he/she accesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>To scan viruses entering through the Internet. </b>An organization can configure its proxy server to scan all incoming messages for potential virus attacks through the Internet. This protects the organization&#39;s computers from virus attacks because many computer viruses penetrate an organization&#39;s systems via the Internet.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>To cache recently accessed web pages. </b>Proxy servers can also speed up performance of some Internet services by caching recently accessed web pages on its local hard disk. If a user within an organization makes a request for a web page, which already exists in the cache of the organization&#39;s proxy server, the proxy server sends the web page to the user&#39;s computer directly from its cache rather than obtaining the web page from the specified Internet server and then forwarding it to the user&#39;s computer. This leads to faster Internet access in many situations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part497.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part499.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
