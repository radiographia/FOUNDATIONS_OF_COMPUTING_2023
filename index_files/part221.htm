Developing software, putting it to use, and maintaining it is a complex process involving the following phases:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Requirement Specification</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. System Analysis and Design</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Implementation (also known as Construction or Code Generation)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. Testing and Debugging</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1420">5. Deployment (also known as Installation)</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6. Maintenance</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Evolving software products through these phases is known as <i>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) </i><a href="part221.htm#bookmark1421" class="s23">model. In this model, we go through the above listed phases sequentially, with each phase feeding in inputs to the next phase [</a><a href="part221.htm#bookmark1421" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">7.3</span>]. Development process proceeds from one phase to the next in a purely sequential manner. Hence, the next phase in the life cycle starts only after the defined set of goals are achieved for its previous phase and it is completed fully, perfected, and frozen. This model is also known as <i>waterfall model </i>because it is a sequential development process, which flows steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the various phases of the process.</p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="490" height="341" alt="image" src="Image_443.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1421">Figure 7.3. </a><span class="s21">Phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model. It is also known as Waterfall model.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A software development team performs the various activities involved in SDLC model. For small software this may be a one-person team (who alone carries out all the activities of all phases), whereas for large software the team may consist of several tens or even hundreds of people with different types of skills. The main activities performed in the various phases of SDLC model are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Requirement specification. </b>The team defines all possible requirements of the software in this phase. These include functionality, capability, performance, user interface, inputs, and outputs requirements. The team records the defined requirements in a requirement specification document, which serves as input to the next phase of the model.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>System analysis and design. </b>The team studies the requirements specified in the first phase with respect to available hardware and software technologies and prepares a system design document. The system design document defines the overall system architecture. It specifies the various hardware and software components of the system and the interfaces between the components. It includes the hierarchy of software components, rules for component selection, and interfaces between components. The design document serves as input to the next phase of the model.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1422">3. </a><b>Implementation. </b>This phase is also known as <i>construction </i>or <i>code generation </i>because in this phase, the team constructs (codes in selected programming languages) the various software components specified in the system design document. While constructing the software components, the team keeps track of the hardware components specified in the system design document so that the constructed software components are compatible with the specified hardware components. To construct a software component, the team first divides it into modules, and then codes each module separately. The team does this, especially for large software, to enable multiple programmers to work parallely on</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">different modules so that they can carry out the implementation phase faster. While dividing software components into modules, the team also defines module interfaces to enable interaction between the modules. The team codes and tests each module independently. This type of testing of a module done by the programmer who developed the module is referred to as <i>unit testing</i>. Unit testing mainly verifies if a module meets its specifications.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Testing and debugging. </b>In this phase, the team integrates the independently developed and tested modules into a complete system. The team then tests the integrated system to check if all modules coordinate properly with each other and the system as a whole behaves as per the specifications. They debug (correct) any bug (error) that they find during integrated system testing, and repeat testing of that functionality of the system. After the team completes this phase, the software is ready for release and deployment.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Deployment. </b>Once the team tests the software and removes all known errors, the team deploys the software at user(s) site on (or along with) associated hardware for use by the intended user(s). At this stage, the team phases out old system (if any in operation) and phases in the new system and puts it into operation. The team also evaluates the system against the specified requirements in this phase.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Maintenance. </b>Some problems with the system, which the team is unable to find during various phases of the development life cycle of the system, surface only after the team deploys the system and puts it in operation. The team fixes these problems in the system in its maintenance phase. Additionally, the team needs to make changes in the system from time-to-time to take care of new user requirements, changes in technology, changes in organizational policies, etc. The team incorporates all these changes in the system in its maintenance phase. Hence, maintenance phase virtually lasts for the entire life of the software after its deployment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part222.htm">Advantages of SDLC Model</a><a class="toc0" href="part223.htm">Limitations of SDLC Model</a><a class="toc0" href="part224.htm">Lightweight SDLC Models</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part220.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part222.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
