Organizations can afford to lay their own communication channels in a smaller geographical area, such as within a building or campus. However, they find it impractical to do so in a larger geographical area, such as between two cities or countries. It is also impractical for them to set up their own satellites in orbit. Therefore, organizations hire services of  data-transmission-service  providers  (known  as  <i>common  carriers</i>)  for  their  data communications needs. Bharti Airtel Ltd., Vodafone Idea Ltd., Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited), and MTNL (Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited) are a few such common carriers in India, whereas AT&amp;T, MCI, Western Union, and GTE are a few such common carriers in the USA. Typically, common carriers offer the following types of services:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Dial-up line. </b>Dial-up line (also known as <i>switched line</i>) service operates like a telephone service. A computer user willing to communicate with a remote computer first makes a connection request by dialing up the remote computer. The communication system then establishes a circuit between the two computers via telephone company&#39;s switching system. Modems attached to the computers then send and receive data over telephone line. Like a telephone call, charge for data transmission service in this case depends on duration of communication (circuit establishment), and distance between the two computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Leased line. </b>Leased line (also known as <i>private line </i>or <i>dedicated line</i>) is a special conditioned telephone line that directly connects two computers or two line terminating equipment (like routers). It can transmit both voice and data. Hence, if an organization has two offices in two different cities, it is often cheaper for the organization to have its own leased-line between two offices for all its voice (telephone calls) and data transmission needs. Often, charges for a leased line are based on channel capacity (bps) and distance (air miles).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). </b>The ISDN is a telephonic system providing digital (not analog) telephone and data services. As it supports digital services (including digitized voice), ISDN telephone users enjoy noise-free, CD-quality, sound.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2198">Moreover, ISDN does not require modems because it supports digital transmission of all types of data (including voice). This also results in short call set-up time between two ISDN subscribers.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Main factor that led to the development of the ISDN was adoption of digital transmission by many public telephone systems. Such networks encode voice traffic using pulse-code modulation at 64 Kbps. Naturally, these networks can carry data also, resulting in integrated digital networks (IDN).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Based on transmission and switching capabilities, the ISDNs are of two types - narrowband ISDN and broadband ISDN. <i>Narrowband ISDN </i>uses multiple 64-Kbps bit- streams  and  combines  them  into  higher-capacity  “trunks”  using  time-division multiplexing. For example, a communication system can combine thirty-two 64-Kbps channels to create one 2-Mbps channel. Narrowband ISDN, however, cannot support requirements of several types of data services, especially those needed for multimedia applications. For example, bandwidth required for full-definition digital video is about 100 Mbps. To handle this type of traffic, as well as bursts of data traffic from computers, communication systems designers introduced <i>broadband ISDN </i>(often referred to as B- ISDN). B-ISDN uses optical fibers and asynchronous time-division multiplexing. Advantage of asynchronous time-division multiplexing over conventional time-division multiplexing is that it allows total bandwidth available to be divided among contending activities in a much more flexible way.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ISDN has become so popular that users and service providers have coined the term <i>Plain Old Telephone Service </i>(<i>POTS</i>) to describe standard analog service.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Value Added Network (VAN). </b>Some companies specialize in providing value added data transmission service over and above the standard services of common carriers. Value- added services include electronic mail, data encryption/decryption, access to commercial databases, and code conversion for communication between incompatible computers. Normally, these companies take dedicated lines of a common carrier on long-term lease, do value addition to enhance communication facilities, and then sell the enhanced service to users. This type of service is known as value-added network (VAN) service.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part441.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part443.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
