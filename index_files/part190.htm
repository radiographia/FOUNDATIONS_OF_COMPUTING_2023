As users speak with different accents (pronounce differently) and intonations (with different tone or pitch of the voice), and the fact that the meaning of a word varies depending on the context in which it is used, speech recognition systems are limited to accepting few words or sentences within a relatively small domain.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part190.htm#bookmark1269" class="s23">A computer with a speech recognition device consists of a microphone and follows the following steps to recognize and act upon a spoken input data (see </a>Figure 6.17<span class="p">):</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="463" height="256" alt="image" src="Image_404.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1269">Figure 6.17. </a><span class="s21">Steps followed in speech recognition by a speech recognition system.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Speak. </b>A user speaks into the microphone attached to it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Convert into electrical signals. </b>The device converts the spoken word(s) into its analog form by converting the word(s) into electrical signals by breaking down each sound into its various frequencies.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Digitize. </b>A digital-to-analog converter in the device then converts the analog form of the spoken word(s) into its digital form (in 1s and 0s) so that the computer can store and interpret it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Match with pre-stored words. </b>The device next matches the digitized version of each spoken word against similarly formed pre-stored words in the computer&#39;s electronic dictionary. A user creates the electronic dictionary (a database of pre-stored words) during a <i>training session</i>, when he/she speaks several times the words and phrases to be stored in its electronic dictionary to train the system to recognize them. When operated in training mode, the device creates and stores the patterns for all spoken words and phrases for future matching.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Perform corresponding action. </b>When the device finds a match for the spoken word(s), it displays  the  word(s)  on  computer&#39;s  screen  and/or  initiates  appropriate  action corresponding to the input (for example, stops doing whatever it was performing). In some case, the system displays the word(s) and waits for the user&#39;s confirmation to prevent doing something different from what the user intended (in case of wrong interpretation of the spoken word(s) by the device). If it does not find a match for the spoken word(s), the system informs the user by displaying a message on computer&#39;s screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1270">Speech recognition systems are of two types:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Speaker-dependent. </b>Due to vast variation in the accent of different speakers, speech recognition systems are usually speaker-dependent. They recognize the speech of only a single individual or a few individuals. In case of multiple individuals, each one of them participates separately in a training session to train the system to recognize his/her accent of pre-stored words in computer&#39;s dictionary. The system usually maintains a separate database of pre-stored words for each individual because the digital form of the same word may be different for different individuals.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Speaker-independent. </b>Speaker-independent speech recognition systems can recognize words spoken by anyone. Since such a system requires a large database of pre-stored words to accommodate anyone&#39;s voice pattern, speaker-independent systems usually have a limited vocabulary. For example, the vocabulary of such a system may have the words YES, NO, ZERO, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, and TEN.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">According to another classification mechanism, two types of speech recognition systems are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Single word recognition systems. </b>These systems can recognize only a single spoken word, such as YES, NO, MOVE, STOP, at a time. Speaker-independent systems are mostly of this type.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Continuous speech recognition systems. </b>These systems can recognize spoken sentences such as MOVE TO THE NEXT BLOCK. Since recognizing continuously spoken</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1272">sentences is more difficult than recognizing words, continuous speech recognition systems are usually speaker-dependent.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A wide range of applications use speech recognition systems. A few examples are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. For data input to a computer system by a person in situations where his/her hands are busy or he/she must continuously look at a measuring instrument or some other object. For example, doctors in an operation room can request certain information about a patient while operating.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. For data input by dictation of long text or passage for later editing and review.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3. For authentication of a user by a computer system based on speech input.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4. For limited use of computers by individuals with physical disabilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to making input of data easier, speech recognition systems also provide freedom of movement because the user is free to stand up, move around, or do some other work by hand while inputting voice data to the system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part189.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part191.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
