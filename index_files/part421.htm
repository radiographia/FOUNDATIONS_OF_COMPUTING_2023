It uses tools and techniques based on machine learning algorithms to find unseen patterns in data to build predictive models. In addition to core data mining steps of running specific knowledge discovery algorithms, data science also includes pre- and post-processing of data and a host of other activities. The five distinct stages involved in data science are (see </a><a href="part421.htm#bookmark2094" class="s3">Figure </a>11.16<span class="p">):</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Data selection. </b>The first step is selection and gathering of both unstructured and structured raw data. This involves data acquisition, data entry and data extraction from various data sources. This step is more significant than it may appear initially, especially when the selection process has to pull data from multiple data sources. In case of multiple data sources, the selection process needs to extract and join data from different databases, and perhaps sample the data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Data preprocessing. </b>The second step is preprocessing of raw data (also called data cleaning) to prepare it for processing. It involves performing the following activities on the raw data:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. Looking for obvious flaws in data and removing them. This involves collecting necessary information to model or account for the flaws, and deciding on strategies for handling missing and unknown values in data fields.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">b. Removing records having errors or insignificant values in certain fields.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">c. Converting certain data items for uniform representation of data in all records. This is often required when selected data is from multiple databases, which use different notations for the same field. For example, one database may represent sex field as 1 for male and 0 for female, while another database uses M for male and F for female. We often refer to the process of <i>data cleaning </i>as <i>data scrubbing</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. <b>Data transformation. </b>The third step is data transformation. It involves performing the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">following activities on the preprocessed data:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a. Converting one type of data to another.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">b. Deriving new variables using mathematical or logical formulae.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">c. Finding useful features to represent the data, depending on the goal of knowledge discovery task.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">d. Using dimensionality reduction or transformation methods to summarize the data for intended knowledge discovery.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2093">4. </a><b>Data mining. </b>The fourth step is data mining. It involves application of core discovery procedures on the transformed data to reveal patterns and new knowledge. This includes searching for patterns of interest in a particular representational form or a set of such representations. Algorithms used for this purpose are known as data mining algorithms. Some popular types of data mining algorithms are classification rules or trees, regression, clustering, sequence modeling, dependency, and line analysis. Hence, data mining involves selection of method(s) for searching useful patterns in the data, such as deciding which models and parameters may be appropriate, and matching a particular data mining method with the overall criteria of knowledge discovery.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Data interpretation/evaluation. </b>The final step is data interpretation/evaluation. It involves interpreting the discovered patterns, as well as possible visualization of the extracted patterns. It first removes redundant or irrelevant patterns, and then uses visualization tools to translate remaining patterns into a form that is easily understandable to its user. The user then incorporates this knowledge into performance system, taking actions based on the knowledge, or documenting it and reporting it to interested parties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="153" alt="image" src="Image_671.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2094">Figure 11.16. </a><span class="s21">The stages involved in data science.</span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part421.htm#bookmark2094" class="s23">Note from </a><a href="part421.htm#bookmark2094" class="s3">Figure </a>11.16<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">that the data science approach of knowledge discovery is not linear, but iterative and interactive.
