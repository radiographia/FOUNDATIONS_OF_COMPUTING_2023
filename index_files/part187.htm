One way to accomplish this is by enabling data entry directly from the source documents by using data scanning devices. These devices have the following characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">1. They eliminate the need for manual entry of data by human beings, thus, improving data accuracy and timeliness of the data processed.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1250">2. They demand high quality of source documents and often reject documents typed poorly, having strikeovers, or having erasures.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">3. Form design and ink specification requirements become more critical with the use of these devices than with the use of keyboard devices for data entry.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">4. Some of these devices are also capable of recognizing marks or characters. Some commonly used types of data scanning devices are described here.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Image Scanner</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An image scanner is an input device that translates paper documents into an electronic format for input to a computer. The input documents may be typed text, pictures, graphics, or even handwritten material. A copy of a document stored in a computer in this manner does not deteriorate in quality with age, and can be displayed or printed, whenever desired. We can alter and manipulate the stored images in interesting ways, if the computer has <i>image-processing software</i>.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1251" class="s23">Image scanners use optical technology to convert an image into electronic form. They shine light on a document and sense the intensity of the reflection at every point of the image. For example, suppose a document has the word “BIT” written on it. The scanner treats the document as if it is on a graph sheet (see </a><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1251" class="s3">Figure </a>6.8<a href="part187.htm#bookmark1251" class="s23">(a)). An intersection of a horizontal and vertical line of the graph is a grid point. If there is a dark spot at a grid point, it is represented by a 1, otherwise it is represented by a 0. </a><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1251" class="s3">Figure </a>6.8<a href="part187.htm#bookmark1251" class="s23">(b) shows the representation of the image of </a><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1251" class="s3">Figure </a>6.8<span class="p">(a). This representation is called </span><span class="s16">bit map representation </span><span class="p">of an image. Each bit in the representation is called a </span><span class="s16">pixel </span><span class="p">(a picture element).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a. A scanned document</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">b. Bitmap representation of the scanned document</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="487" height="178" alt="image" src="Image_395.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1251">Figure 6.8. </a><span class="s21">A scanned document and its bitmap representation.</span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1251" class="s23">The finer is the granularity of grid points, the better the scanner is because it can convert an image with greater accuracy. Scanners having 300 to 600 grid points per inch are common. Moreover, </a><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1251" class="s3">Figure </a>6.8<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows the use of just 1 bit for encoding of each grid point. High quality black-and-white scanners and color scanners use more bits to represent each grid point. For example, a good quality black-and-white scanner might use 4 bits per grid point to encode different shades from black to gray to white. Similarly, a color scanner might use 24 bits per grid point to represent a maximum of 256 different shades of color.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The two commonly used types of image scanners are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Flatbed scanner. </b><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1253" class="s23">A flatbed scanner is like a document copy machine. It has a box with a glass plate on its top and a lid that covers the glass plate (see </a><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1253" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.9</span>). To scan a document, a user places it upside down on the glass plate. A light beam below the glass plate moves horizontally from one end to another when activated. After scanning one line, the light beam moves up a little and scans the next line. The process repeats until the beam finishes scanning the entire document. It takes about 20 seconds to scan a document of 21</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">cm ´ 28 cm size.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1252">2. </a><b>Hand-held scanner. </b><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1254" class="s23">A hand-held scanner (see </a><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1254" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.10</span>) has a set of light emitting diodes encased in a small case that conveniently fits in hand. To scan a document, a user drags it steadily over the document from one end to another with its light on. Hand-held scanners are used to scan low volume documents. They are much cheaper than flatbed scanners.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 174pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="176" height="146" alt="image" src="Image_396.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1253">Figure 6.9. </a><span class="s21">A flatbed scanner.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 192pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="129" height="150" alt="image" src="Image_397.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1254">Figure 6.10. </a><span class="s21">A hand-held scanner.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Device</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We can use image scanners to input a variety of documents including pictures, graphics, typed text, and handwritten text. When we use them for inputting text documents (typed or handwritten), we face the following limitations:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. Since a scanned input document is stored as an image, instead of text, it is not possible to do any word processing of the document (the computer cannot interpret the stored document as letters, numbers, and special characters).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. Storage space required for storing the document as an image is much more than that required for storing the same document as a text. For example, a page of printed text having 2000 characters can be stored as 2000 bytes by using the ASCII representation. A bitmap-image representation of the same document requires 10 to 15 times more storage depending on the resolution (granularity) of grid points.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An OCR device overcomes these limitations. It has a scanner equipped with character recognition software (called OCR software), which converts bitmap images of characters to equivalent ASCII codes. The scanner first creates the bitmap image of the document and then the OCR software translates the array of grid points into ASCII text that the computer can interpret</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">as letters, numbers, and special characters.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To translate bitmaps of characters into equivalent text, OCR software examines the bitmap of each character and compares with the pre-programmed set of characters, which the machine can recognize. Whichever character pattern it matches, or nearly matches, the machine considers it as the input character. If a scanned character does not match satisfactorily with any of the stored character patterns, the OCR software rejects it.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1255" class="s23">OCR software is designed to recognize texts written using standard type fonts (called OCR fonts) only. Two such standard fonts are OCR-A (American standard) and OCR-B (European standard) (see </a><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1255" class="s3">Figure </a>6.11<span class="p">). If a document contains italics or bold face letters, or text written using fonts which the OCR software cannot recognize, then the OCR software will not be able to translate it correctly.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Modern OCR devices can also recognize handwritten characters. In this case, users have to take special care to ensure that in the handwritten document, characters are of standard size, lines making up the characters are connected, and no stylish loops etc. are used. OCR devices for converting handwritten text into ASCII are more complex and difficult to design than those for printed text. This is because handwritings of different users are different, making the parameters for how individual characters are formed very broad.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="506" height="170" alt="image" src="Image_398.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1255">Figure 6.11. </a><span class="s21">Two standard OCR fonts.</span><a name="bookmark1256">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Optical Mark Reader (OMR)</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1257" class="s23">OMR is a scanner that can recognize a pre-specified type of mark made by pencil or pen. For example, in objective type tests, applicants mark their choices of correct answers on a special pre-printed test scoring sheet by darkening a small square, circular, or oval shaped box by a pencil (see </a><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1257" class="s3">Figure </a>6.12<span class="p">). These answer sheets are fed to an OMR device for automatic grading by a computer.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="502" height="282" alt="image" src="Image_399.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 172pt;text-indent: -161pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1257">Figure 6.12. </a><span class="s21">A sample question sheet of an objective type test and its pre-printed answer sheet, which is read by an OMR device to grade the test.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An OMR device focusses a light beam on the document and detects the reflected light pattern from the marks. Pencil marks made with a soft lead pencil (high graphite content) reflect the light strongly, enabling the OMR device to determine which responses are marked.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">OMR devices require that the pre-printed forms use good quality paper without any foldings. They also require accurate alignment of markings in the boxes for correct interpretation of input data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We can use OMR devices for any input data that is of a choice or selection nature. Thus, in addition to their use for grading tests with objective type questions, they are often used to tabulate responses to large surveys where responses are restricted to one or more out of a few possibilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1258">Bar-Code Reader</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Data coded in the form of small lines (known as bars) are known as bar codes. <i>Bar codes </i>represent alphanumeric data by a combination of adjacent vertical lines (bars) by varying their width and the spacing between them. All types of goods, books, postal packages, badges, tags, etc. use bar codes for unique identification purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A bar-code reader is a device for reading (decoding) bar-coded data. It is either a hand-held or a stationary scanner having bar-code reader embedded in it. It scans a bar-code image and converts it into an alphanumeric value for input to a computer connected to it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A bar-code reader uses laser-beam scanning technology. It focuses a laser beam across the pattern of bars of a bar code. Different bar codes having different patterns of bars reflect the beam in different ways. A light-sensitive detector senses the reflected light patterns and converts them into electrical pulses, which the reader then transmits to recognition logic circuits. Finally, the logic circuits convert the electrical pulses into an alphanumeric value.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are many types of bar-coding systems. The most widely known one is the <i>Universal</i></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Product Code <span class="p">(</span>UPC<a href="part187.htm#bookmark1259" class="s23">). It appears on almost all retail packages in USA and now in India as well on many products. The UPC bar-code patterns decode as 10 digits. The first five digits identify the manufacturer or supplier of the product, and the next five digits identify a specific product of the manufacturer (see </a><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1259" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">6.13</span><span class="p">).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We often find bar code readers in supermarkets and department stores. When a customer picks up a product for purchasing and brings it to the cash counter for payment, the sales person at the counter uses a bar-code reader to scan the bar code printed on the product. The bar-code reader converts the bar code into an alphanumeric value and feeds it to a computer that looks up the price of the product, possibly updates inventory and sales records, and uses the price and description information to prepare a purchase bill for the customer. Postal and goods delivery services also use bar codes to identify and track each packet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="355" height="163" alt="image" src="Image_400.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1259">Figure 6.13. </a><span class="s21">An example of UPC bar code.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Magnetic-Ink Character Recognition (MICR)</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1260" class="s23">MICR is similar to OCR. Banking industry uses it for faster processing of large volume of cheques handled every day by this industry. A bank cheque has bank&#39;s identification code (name, branch, etc.), account number, and cheque number pre-printed (encoded) on it by using characters from a special character set. The characters on the cheque are pre-printed using a special ink containing particles of iron oxide (having magnetic property). </a><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1260" class="s3">Figure </a>6.14<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows a sample cheque that employs MICR technology.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="506" height="214" alt="image" src="Image_401.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1260">Figure 6.14. </a><span class="s21">A bank cheque that employs MICR technology.</span><a name="bookmark1261">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When a customer presents a filled-in cheque at a bank, a bank employee enters manually (keys in) the customer-supplied information, including the amount written on the cheque. The bank then processes this cheque by using an MICR reader-sorter, which reads the pre-printed data on the cheques, and sorts the cheques into different pockets according to their identification code numbers for distribution to other banks, or for further processing.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part187.htm#bookmark1262" class="s23">E13B font is the most commonly used character set by MICR devices.

However, other industries have not adopted MICR because it has only 14 symbols (10 digits and 4 special characters). No alphabetic characters are available.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="209" height="163" alt="image" src="Image_402.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1262">Figure 6.15. </a><span class="s21">E13B font (character set) used by MICR devices.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part186.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part188.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
