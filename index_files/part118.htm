That is, the CPU and memory interact frequently. To enable this interaction, the two units of a computer system need some type of connectivity between them. This connectivity channel is known as a <i>bus</i>. Physically, a bus is a set of wires, which carries a group of bits in parallel and has an associated control scheme. <i>Width </i>of a bus is defined as the number of parallel lines (wires) in the bus. Every</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">computer system has the following three types of buses for interconnecting the CPU and memory:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark998">1. </a><b>Data bus. </b>A system uses data bus to transfer data between CPU and memory. When people refer to the bus of a computer system, they usually mean the data bus.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Width of data bus is an important parameter that affects the overall performance of a computer system. This is because each wire of a bus can transfer one bit at a time. Hence, an 8-bit bus (one having 8 parallel wires) can transfer 8 bits (one byte), a 16-bit bus can transfer two bytes, and a 32-bit bus can transfer four bytes at a time. A wider data bus enables more bits of data to be transferred simultaneously, resulting in faster exchange of data. This is analogous to a multi-lane highway, the wider the highway, the more traffic can flow simultaneously.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Address bus. </b>In order to retrieve some data from memory, it is necessary to specify the address of the location where the data is stored. A system uses address bus to carry the address of a memory location whenever it has to transfer data to or from memory.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Obviously, width of address bus must be equal to the number of bits in memory address register (MAR) of the system. Width of address bus is an important parameter for a computer system because it determines the maximum number of memory locations that the computer system can have. For example, if address bus is 8 bits wide, the CPU can address only 256 bytes of memory. Early personal computers had 20-bit wide address buses, so the CPU could address 2<span class="s22">20 </span>bytes, or 1 MB, of memory. Today, most systems have 64-bit wide address buses so that the CPU can address 2<span class="s22">64 </span>bytes of memory.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Control bus. </b>In addition to sending addresses and exchanging data with memory, the CPU also needs to send control signals to memory to specify whether to read or write the data to the specified address location. The control bus carries such signals, which are in the form of <i>READ/WRITE </i>commands.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part118.htm#bookmark999" class="s23">Thus, a memory access by the CPU involves all three buses - control bus carries memory access command, address bus carries memory address, and data bus carries the data. </a><a href="part118.htm#bookmark999" class="s3">Figure </a>4.9<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows the three buses used for interconnecting the CPU and main memory for enabling this.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 135pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="280" height="114" alt="image" src="Image_318.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark999">Figure 4.9. </a><span class="s21">Three types of buses used between the CPU and main memory.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part117.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part119.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
