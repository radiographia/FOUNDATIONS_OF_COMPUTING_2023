Most modern magnetic tapes have 9 tracks, and use 8-bit EBCDIC code format for data recording (see </a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1088" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">5.2</span>). The fourth track records parity bit. A <i>parity bit </i>or <i>check bit </i>enables detection of errors that may occur due to loss of a bit from a string of 8 bits during data input or output operations. In <i>odd-parity, </i>the check bit is 0, if the total number of 1 bits for representing a character is odd and it is 1, otherwise. On the other hand, in <i>even parity</i><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1088" class="s23">, the check bit is 0 if the total number of 1 bits for representing a character is even and it is 0, otherwise. The tape in </a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1088" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">5.2</span> uses the parity bit for an odd parity. Notice that, it represents letter A by its 8-bit EBCDIC code 11000001.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="246" alt="image" src="Image_338.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: -71pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1088"><b>Figure 5.2. </b></a>Data recording on a 9 track magnetic tape using 8-bit EBCDIC code format. Here the 4<span class="s36">th </span>track is used for an odd-parity. Hence, all frames contain an odd number of 1 bits.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A magnetic tape is a continuous medium, which records data serially. There is no addressing. In this situation, how different pieces of data (known as <i>records</i>) are identified on a tape? For this, it separates records by blank spaces called <i>inter-record gaps </i>( <i>IRG</i>). A tape drive creates IRGs automatically as it writes data on tape. Each IRG is about 0.5 inches. While reading data from a moving tape, a tape drive stops tape movement when it encounters an IRG. The tape remains stationary until the record processing is over, and then moves again to read the next record. This process repeats for all records in a file.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Records are of varying lengths. When a tape contains a large number of short records with an IRG after each record, more than half of the tape is unused (occupied with IRGs). Moreover,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">tape I/O operation also becomes slow due to frequent interruption in tape movement during I/O operations. To overcome these problems, it groups records in blocks, and separates blocks by blank spaces called inter-block gaps (IBG). The process of grouping two or more records together to form a block of data is known as <i>blocking</i>, and the number of records grouped together in each block is called <i>blocking factor</i>. Blocking factor depends on record length. To reduce wastage of tape storage space, the general rule followed for deciding blocking factor is - a block should be at least ten times as long as the IBG.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to better utilization of tape storage space, blocking also helps in faster tape I/O operations. It permits transmission of multiple records with each “read” or “write” operation. Each tape “read” operation transmits all records of the next block from the tape to memory. Similarly, a tape “write” operation transmits an entire block of records from memory to tape drive, which then writes a block of data and an IBG on the tape.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1090" class="s3" name="bookmark1089">Figure </a>5.3<span class="s10"> </span><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1090" class="s23">illustrates the concept of blocking. </a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1090" class="s3">Figure </a>5.3<a href="part133.htm#bookmark1090" class="s23">(a) shows an unblocked tape (one that does not use blocking), </a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1090" class="s3">Figure 5.3</a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1090" class="s23">(b) shows a tape that uses a blocking factor of two, and </a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1090" class="s3">Figure</a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1090" class="s24"> </a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1090" class="s3">5.3</a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1090" class="s23">(c) shows a tape that uses a blocking factor of three.

A single tape normally stores several files. To separate one file from another when they are stored sequentially one after another on a tape, the system adds a file header label and a file trailer label respectively at the beginning and at the end of each file. <i>File header label </i>identifies the beginning of a file and contains the file&#39;s attributes such as its name (file identifier), date of creation, etc. <i>File trailer label </i><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1091" class="s23">signifies the end of a file and contains total number of records in the file. </a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1091" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">5.4</span> shows data organization on a magnetic tape with file header and file trailer labels.</p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="123" alt="image" src="Image_340.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1091">Figure 5.4. </a><span class="s21">Data organization on a magnetic tape with file header and file trailer labels.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A tape drive wounds a tape on a spool and moves it during tape I/O operations from a supply spool to a take-up spool. To allow for threading on the take-up and supply spools, the first and the last several feet of a tape are unused (not used for any type of information recording). After the unused length towards the beginning of tape, there is a reflective metal foil known as <i>beginning of tape </i>( <i>BOT</i>) <i>marker </i>to indicate to the tape drive the beginning of usable tape. Similarly, before the unused length towards the end of tape, there is another reflective metal foil known as <i>end of tape </i>(<i>EOT</i>) <i>marker </i>to indicate the end of usable tape. These two markers are on opposite edges of the tape for machine identification purposes. Between BOT marker and the first file header label is a <i>tape header label</i><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1092" class="s23">, which contains the tape&#39;s attributes such as its identifier, number of files it contains, date of its last use, and other control information, which help to prevent an important tape from accidental eraser. </a><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1092" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">5.5</span> shows data organization on a magnetic tape with BOT and EOT markers, and tape header label.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="507" height="167" alt="image" src="Image_341.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1092">Figure 5.5. </a><span class="s21">Data organization on a magnetic tape with BOT and EOT markers and tape header label.</span><a name="bookmark1093">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Storage Capacity</h4><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Storage capacity of a tape = Data recording density × Length</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Data recording density is the amount of data that can be stored on a given length of tape. We measure it in <i>bytes per inch </i>( <i>bpi</i>), or number of bytes (characters) that can be stored per linear inch of tape. Tape density varies from 800 bpi in older systems to 77,000 bpi in modern systems. Hence, if a 2400 feet tape has a data recording density of 800 bpi, its storage capacity will be 2400 × 12 inches × 800 bpi = 23 × 10<span class="s22">6 </span>bytes = 23 Mega bytes. This is the total (raw) storage capacity of the tape. Its actual storage capacity (storage available for storing user data) is much less due to use of IBGs. In fact, actual storage capacity of a tape may be anywhere from 35% to 70% of its raw storage capacity depending on storage organization.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Data Transfer Rate</h4><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Data transfer rate <span class="p">of a tape is the number of characters transmitted per second from the tape to primary storage. We measure it in </span>bytes per second <span class="p">( </span>bps<span class="p">). Its value depends on data recording density and speed of tape movement under read/write head. Tape speed is typically of the order of 100 inches per second. Hence, for a tape having data recording density of 77,000 bpi and its drive having tape speed of 100 inches per second, data transfer rate is 77,000 × 100 = 77,00,000 bytes or roughly 7.7 MB per second.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tape Drive</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A <i>magnetic tape drive </i>enables storage/retrieval of data on/from tape. It has read/write heads. As tape ribbon passes under the read/write heads, it can read/write data from/to the tape by giving suitable commands (<i>read </i>or <i>write</i>) to the tape drive. We have to first load a magnetic tape reel, cartridge, or cassette on to a tape drive attached to a computer for processing. The magnetic tape is <i>on-line </i>once we load it on a magnetic tape drive. The computer can now use it for storage or retrieval of data. When processing is complete, we remove the tape from the tape drive for <i>off- line </i>storage (away from the computer system), and data on it becomes inaccessible until we load it again on the tape drive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tape Controller</h4><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part133.htm#bookmark1094" class="s23">We must mount a magnetic tape on a tape drive, before we can use it for reading/writing of information.
