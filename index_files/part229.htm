Such program errors typically involve incorrect punctuation, incorrect word sequence, undefined terms, or misuse of terms. For example, the FORTRAN statement <i>C = (A + B/2 </i>has a syntax error; the missing closing parenthesis that should be placed in the appropriate place depending on the logic of the program. A compiler will not compile a program successfully until its programmer corrects all its syntax errors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Logic errors. </b><i>Logic errors </i>occur when we make errors in planning the program&#39;s logic or while converting the logic into program code. They cause the program to produce incorrect result or behave unexpectedly. A compiler will compile a program successfully, if it is free of syntax errors, even if it has one or more logic errors. Although we can execute such a program, but it will not produce correct result or will not behave as expected. For example, if a FORTRAN instruction should be “A = B + C” but the programmer has coded it wrongly as “A = B - C”, it is an example of a logic error because the program will not produce correct result. Similarly, if one has wrongly entered 999999 (only six 9s) instead of 9999999 (seven 9s) as the sentinel value for <i>Rollno </i>in the instruction for detecting the end of last record, the program will expect more records even after the last record (sentinel values are introduced in a later chapter).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In case of a logic error, since a programmer does not violate any rule of the programming language, the computer cannot identify the error. Hence, it does not produce any error message for a logic error. Therefore, identifying logic errors in a program is the responsibility of the program development and testing team. The testing procedure involves running the program to process input test data, and comparing the obtained results with the known correct results. If the results obtained for the test data do not match with the known correct results, most likely the program contains one or more logic errors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Logic errors are typically due to either missing logic or incorrect logic. If the logic is incorrect, the results obtained for the test data will be wrong. These errors are the easiest of the logic errors to find. Errors caused by missing logic result from logical situations</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that the programmer did not think of while planning/writing the program. For example, let us assume that an arithmetic process uses a numeric field and the data entry operator has entered a non-numeric value in it. The program logic should determine that the data is not numeric before attempting the arithmetic process. If this logic is missing, the program will fail when the arithmetic process encounters non-numeric data. This type of logic error can be difficult to find. This error will occur only when a user enters nonnumeric data in a numeric field. Users may use the program for weeks, months, or years before this happens and the error in program logic shows up.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part228.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part230.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
