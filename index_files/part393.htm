Apple Watch also being a mobile device (although, much smaller), WatchOS is based on iOS and has many similarities with iOS in terms of features. Moreover, many of the applications supported by WatchOS are miniaturized and simplified versions of their iOS counterparts.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1987">The main features of WatchOS include the following:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Intuitive user interface </b>makes it easy to use Apple Watch by anyone. The home screen has circular application icons, which can be zoomed in and out. A user can launch an application by touching its icon on the screen. In addition to being touch-sensitive, the screen is also pressure sensitive. Hence, a user can tap or deep press on the icons to invoke different actions and options. The watch also has side buttons to invoke certain features.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>HealthKit </b>is a crucial element of Apple Watch and its designers have designed both its hardware and WatchOS to support health-based capabilities. WatchOS along with associated health-based applications allow users to view visual graphs for all-day heart rate, resting rate, walking average, workout average, current and historical details of heart rate, etc. The watch can even notify its user, when his/her heart rate rises above a specified threshold. Hence, Apple Watch encourages users to exercise and diagnoses and notifies illness to users.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Music </b>is yet another important element of Apple Watch. WatchOS along with associated music-based applications allow users to quickly select and play songs/music of their choice. It also has the ability to start a synced music playlist automatically when a user starts his/her workout session.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Contacts list, calendar with notifications for important dates, appointments, calculator, etc. are a few other useful applications available to Apple Watch users.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Ability to share data with other Apple devices. </b>For example, a user can choose to transfer health-based data captured by Apple Watch for storing it on any other Apple device having larger storage (iPhone, iPad, laptop, or desktop).</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part392.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part394.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
