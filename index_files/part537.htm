Some commonly used methods of passive attack are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2530">1. </a><b>Browsing. </b>An intruder using this method of attack attempts to read stored files, message packets passing by on a network, other processes&#39; memory, and so on, without modifying any data. Systems use access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized reading of stored files and other processes&#39; memory contents, and message encryption to prevent eavesdropping of messages transmitted over network links.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Leaking. </b>An intruder using this method of attack uses an accomplice (a legitimate user having authority to access the sensitive information) who leaks the information to him/her/it. Prevention of leaking is a difficult problem to solve and requires preventing all types of communication between the accomplice and the intruder. The problem of ensuring that it is impossible for a potential accomplice to leak any information to the outside world is called <i>confinement problem</i>. Confinement problem is in general unsolvable. Hence, as of now, securing a system against leaking attack is not possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>lnferencing. </b>An intruder using this method of attack tries to draw some inference by closely observing and analyzing a system&#39;s data or activities carried out by the system. For example, if a system encrypts some information to protect its unauthorized access, an intruder may try to derive the encryption key by analyzing several pieces of encrypted data. The intruder can subsequently use the derived key for stealing information from the system. He/she may even sell the key to other intruders. Another example of inferencing is traffic analysis in distributed systems. In this case, an intruder observes when and where inter-process messages flow in the system and by analyzing the frequency of message exchanges between various communicating partners, the intruder tries to draw some inference. For example, in a business environment, traffic analysis may provide useful clues to negotiations taking place between different organizations.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Masquerading. </b>An intruder using this method of attack masquerades as an authorized user or program in order to gain access to unauthorized data or resources. For instance, many systems have mechanisms to allow users to use programs written by other users. These programs can improperly use the access rights of an executing user and leak information. For example, an intruder may write an editor program that works perfectly as an editor, but also creates a copy of the edited file to a special area accessible to the intruder. The intruder then compiles this editor program and stores it into <i>bin </i>directory of a user, in whose files the intruder is interested. From then onwards, the intruder gets a copy of all the files edited by the user. The user is ignorant of the theft because the editor program performs all his/her editing jobs in a normal fashion.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Penetrating computer security in this manner is known as <i>Trojan horse attack. </i>A <i>Trojan horse program</i>, therefore, is a program that consists of clandestine code to do nasty things in addition to its usual function, but appears to be benign. An intruder often offers it as a gift or as a product having nominal price to prevent suspicion. Normally, a user accepts it into his/her system because of the useful function it performs. However, once inside the user&#39;s computer system, the code hidden in the program becomes active and either executes malicious acts or creates a way of subverting system security so that unauthorized personnel can gain access to the system resources. Note that a Trojan horse attack may be either passive or active depending on the activities performed by the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">clandestine code. For example, if the clandestine code simply steals information, it is of passive type. However, if it does something more harmful like destroying/corrupting files, it is of active type.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An intruder can also masquerade as a trusted server to a client requesting a service from the system. This action is known as <i>spoofing.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part536.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part538.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
