Governments around the world have realized that they can also make use of IT to provide better services to citizens and business. As a result, many organizations have developed IT applications for use in various government departments. <i>Electronic Governance </i>(commonly known as <i>e-governance </i>in short) has emerged as a keyword to refer to all such IT applications. Often e-governance means an IT driven system of governance that works better, costs less, and is capable of servicing the needs of citizens and businesses better than a conventional system of governance. Its goal is to create a more responsive, productive, and effective administration. We also refer to e-governance as <b>SMART </b>governance because it aims at using IT to the processes of government functioning to bring about <b>S</b>imple, <b>M</b>oral, <b>A </b>ccountable, <b>R</b>esponsive, and <b>T </b>ransparent governance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part601.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part603.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
