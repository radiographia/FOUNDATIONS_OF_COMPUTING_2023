Additionally, assemblers detect and indicate errors automatically for use of an invalid mnemonic op- code or an undefined name. For example, if an assembly language program instruction reads ADD AREA and the programmer has not defined AREA in the program, the assembler will indicate the error after looking through its table and not finding AREA in it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Easier to correct or modify. </b>Since they are easier to understand, it is easier to locate, correct, and modify instructions of an assembly language program than a machine language program. Moreover, insertion or removal of certain instructions in a program does not require change in the address part of the instructions following that part of the program. This is required in case of machine language.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1725">4. </a><b>No worry about addresses. </b>Assembly language programmers need not keep track of storage locations of data and instructions while writing an assembly language program. For example, let us assume that we have written a long machine language program involving many instructions and several references to itself within the program such as looping, branching, and so on. Towards the end of the program, we discover that we have left out an instruction in the middle. If we insert that instruction, we will have to go through the entire program to check and modify (if necessary) all references to other instructions. This is a tedious job. However, if we write the same program in assembly language, we merely add the extra instruction, and the assembler takes care of modifying the references automatically.</p><p style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="287" alt="image" src="Image_571.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1726">Figure 9.6. </a><a href="part310.htm#bookmark1721" class="s42">Equivalent machine language program for the assembly language program of </a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 10pt;">Figure 9.4</span><span class="s21">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Easily relocatable. </b>Availability of pseudo-instructions for instructing the system how we want it to assemble a program inside the computer&#39;s memory makes assembly language programs easily re-locatable. This is because we can easily change a program&#39;s location by changing the pseudo-instructions. An example can best illustrate this feature. Let us assume that an assembly language program starts at address 1000, and we suddenly find that this program uses another program, which also starts at location 1000. Obviously, we will have to rewrite one of the two programs to move it to some other location. While this is a complicated task in machine language, in assembly language, we merely have to change the pseudo-instructions for assembling the program for one of the two programs. For example, change the following pseudo-instructions:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">START PROGRAM AT 1000 START DATA AT 2000</p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">to the following pseudo-instructions: START PROGRAM AT 3000 START DATA AT 4000</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and run the assembly language program once again through the assembler. The equivalent machine language program will this time start at memory location 3000 instead of 1000, and there will be no conflict with the other program.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <b>Efficiency of machine language. </b>An assembly language program also enjoys the efficiency of its corresponding machine language program because there is one-to-one correspondence between the instructions of an assembly language program and its corresponding machine language program. Hence, leaving out the translation time required by the assembler, the execution time for an assembly language program and its equivalent machine language program (written independently) would be more or less the same.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part310.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part312.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
