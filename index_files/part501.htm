Several billions of users access the Internet from various countries across the world. The size of the Internet over the last few years has grown and continues to grow exponentially.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Presently, the Internet works on IPV4 (Internet Protocol Version 4), which is known as IP. This protocol has been around since 1978. By middle of 1990s, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) realized that IPV4 has several limitations and the Internet of future will need a new version of Internet Protocol (IP). IETF identified the following major limitations in IPV4:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. IPV4&#39;s 32-bit address space is not sufficient to accommodate enough Internet addresses to cope up with the growing size of the Internet and its user community.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. IPV4 lacks features to support multimedia applications needing real-time or time-sensitive services. This is because multimedia applications were not popular when IPV4 was originally designed.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. IPV4 has no support for security at IP layer. With several Internet applications dealing with critical data, security has become an important issue.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. IPV4 has limited mobility support, which has become a need for the users dealing with mobile applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To address these limitations, IETF developed and proposed a new version of the Internet Protocol, which is popularly known as IPV6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) or Next Generation IP. The key features of IPV6 are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. It uses 128-bit address space instead of 32-bit in IPV4. Hence, the Internet under IPV6 can support 10<span class="s22">15 </span>(quadrillion) hosts and 10<span class="s22">12 </span>(trillion) networks (the Internet under IPV4 can support maximum 2<span class="s22">32 </span>hosts). Therefore, the IPV6 address space is approximately 64 x</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">10<span class="s22">9 </span>times more than that of IPV4.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2348">2. It uses flow labeling and priority concepts to support real-time services. Senders can attach priority labels to packets. The protocol uses time-sensitive approach to service higher-priority packets (usually belonging to real-time applications), and best effort approach  to  service  low-priority  packets  (usually  belonging  to  time  insensitive applications). Senders can also request special handling of packets by routers by assigning flow labels to them, such as a non-default quality of service or real-time service. With this feature, the protocol can treat video and audio data as flows, and traditional data (such as file transfer and e-mail) as ordinary.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. IPV6 with its ancillary security protocol provides a better communication tool for secure business transaction over the Internet. With a longer address field, IPV6 permits extensions to support authentication, data integrity, and data confidentiality, for addressing a variety of critical security concerns.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Enhanced routing capability of IPV6 includes support for mobile hosts. This feature allows a node to move from one link to another without changing its IP address. Movement can even be heterogeneous, that is, a node can move from an Ethernet link to a cellular packet network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Besides unicast and multicast, IPV6 has provision for anycast addressing, which allows delivery of a packet to any one of a group of hosts belonging to an anycast address.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. IPV6 permits auto-configuration, which allows IP-enabled devices to gain full access to the Internet without requiring time-consuming manual configuration.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. IPV6 uses improved packet header format by dropping the least used options from IPV4 packet header format. It also has improved support for extensions that brings greater flexibility in operations. All these features permit more efficient packet handling.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part502.htm">Benefits of IoT</a><a class="toc0" href="part503.htm">IoT Applications (Uses of IoT)</a><a class="toc0" href="part504.htm">Challenges in Adoption of IoT</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part500.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part502.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
