Normally, professional programmers create and maintain large databases on large computer systems. Users of these databases, however, need not be programmers. Non-programmers can use these databases easily to access data and produce reports. On the other hand, many DBMSs for personal computer systems enable non-programmers to not only use, but even to create their own databases. Normally, these databases are simple in structure and small in size.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Creating a Database</h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Creation of a database is a three steps process:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Defining its structure (schema)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Designing forms (custom screens) for displaying and entering data</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Entering data into it These steps are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Schema Definition</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To set up a database, a database designer has to first define its structure (schema definition). This is done by identifying the characteristics of each field in it. A good way to begin defining the schema of a database is to list down on paper all fields that the designer can think of for inclusion in the database, and then to determine the name, type, and size of each field. The designer has to then use a tool called <i>schema builder </i>to capture this information into the system. Schema builder enables the designer to define a database schema interactively by prompting him/her to enter the name, type, size, etc. for each field.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While defining the schema of a database, it is important to consider possible future needs and needs of all types of users of the database. That is, while defining the database structure, the designer should include in it all possible fields that all types of users of the database may need. Although it is possible to modify database structure at any time, making such modifications is a time-consuming process. Hence, it is better to carefully design a database in the first instance, and minimize the need to modify its structure later.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Designing Forms</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s23">After defining the structure of a database, the next step is to design forms (custom screens) for convenient data entry. Each form displays a set of fields of database structure with appropriate amount of blank spaces against each to enable data entry in those fields. </a><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s3">Figure </a>11.12<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows such a form.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To facilitate easier data entry, a designer often designs these forms with several fancy features, such as:</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s23">1. A list-box for a field listing the options from which users can select a choice. For example, in </a><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s3">Figure </a>11.12<span class="p">, SEX field may have a list-box listing options “Male” and “Female,” out of which a user selects one while entering an employee&#39;s sex information, and the system accordingly enters “M” or “F” in SEX field. Similarly, STATE field may have a list-box listing all states, from which a user can select an option while inputting an employee&#39;s address.</span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s23">2. Simple validation checks for a field to ensure correctness of input data to some extent. For example, in </a><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s3">Figure </a>11.12<span class="p">, the designer may define a validation check for POSTAL CODE field to accept only six numeric characters. With this, the field will not accept less than or more than six characters, and will also not accept alphabetic or special characters. Similarly, the designer may define a validation check for AGE field to accept values in the range 18 to 70 only (both inclusive). Validation checks also enable designers to force a certain character position of a field to be a letter or numeral.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="470" height="435" alt="image" src="Image_665.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2071">Figure 11.12. </a><span class="s21">A typical database form used for data entry.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Automatic conversion of characters input by a user in certain fields to upper- or lower- case. For example, the system may be designed to accept “mh”, “Mh”, “mH” or “MH” for state code of Maharashtra, and will convert the entry to “MH” automatically. This feature eases data entry and ensures uniformity of data.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. Automatic formatting of certain fields. For example, the system may be designed to display the value of TELEPHONE NO. field automatically in the specified format (with parentheses, space, and hyphen). Hence, when a user enters telephone number as “02056804892”, the system automatically displays “(020) 5680-4892” in that field.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Entering Data</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After a designer completes designing the forms of a database, the database is ready for entry of data. Users enter data in the database one record at a time. To enter data, a user issues a command that calls up and displays the appropriate form with blank fields. The user then keys in data for each field in its respective space. In this manner, the user enters data for the first record, then for the second record, and so on. Most database systems automatically assign a serial number to each record, when the user enters the record.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Usually, a user can use the <i>Tab </i>or <i>Enter </i>key to move to the next field, while entering data in a form. Pressing <i>Enter </i>or <i>Tab </i>key in the last field of the form saves the record in database and moves to a new, blank form for the next record&#39;s data entry. In addition to using the <i>Tab </i>or <i>Enter</i></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">key to move forward through fields, the user can directly go to any field on the form by clicking on it with the mouse.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2072">Viewing, Modifying, Deleting, and Adding Records</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All database systems provide commands to add, delete, view, or modify records of a database. The command for viewing a record enables a user to display data in various fields of a record in the same screen format as that of the form for data entry. A user selects a record for viewing by specifying its key field value. Usually, database systems also provide the flexibility to users to move between records for viewing different records, such as “go to the first record”, “go to the previous record”, “go to the next record”, and “go to the last record”.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many database systems also provide the facility to set up <i>filters</i><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s23">, which allow users to browse through and view those records only that meet some criterion. For example, in an employee database, which a user can create by using the form of </a><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">11.12</span>, if the user wants to view the records of only female employees, the user can set a filter for “Sex” field, and the system will display only the records containing “F” in that field. Note that while a filter is set, the user cannot access the records that do not meet the filter criteria. Filters provide a quick and convenient way to narrow down the number of records with which the users have to work.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The command for modifying a record enables a user to not only view, but also to update data in various fields of a record. To modify the contents of a field of a record, the user first displays the record, then uses the mouse to position the cursor in the field at the character position where he/she wants to perform editing, and then edits the contents of the field. Similarly, the user can edit data in any other field of the record. Finally, the user presses the <i>Enter </i>key for changes to take effect. Some database systems may prompt the user to confirm the changes made, before effecting the changes and allowing the user to move to another record.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The command for deleting a record enables a user to remove records from a database. To delete a record, a user first selects the record, either by specifying its key field value, or by using the facility to move between records just as is done in the case of viewing a record. The user then uses the delete command, to delete the record. Most database systems prompt the user to confirm deletion of the record before deleting it. This feature prevents deletion of a record by mistake.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The command for adding a record enables a user to add new records to a database. When a user enables this command, the system displays a blank form and waits for the user to enter the data. The user then keys in the data for each field in its respective space. After keying the data in the last field, the user presses the <i>Enter </i>or <i>Tab </i>key, to save the record. On doing this, the system displays a new blank form for the next record&#39;s data entry. If the user does not want to add any more records, he/she uses the mouse to select the option to terminate the process for adding new records.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Searching for Desired Information</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A database management system enables its users to quickly search for the desired information from the large volume of data in a database. Modern database systems commonly support the following features for this:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Find command</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. Query language</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 170%;text-align: justify;">3. Query By Example (QBE) These features are described here.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Find Command</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Find <a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s23">command is for simple database queries, like searching for records having a particular string pattern in a field. For example, in an employee database, which a user can create by using the form of </a><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">11.12</span><span class="p">, the user can use </span>Find <span class="p">command to list the records of all employees whose last name is “SINHA”. Similarly, the user may use this command to list the records of all employees who belong to the city of “PUNE”.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2073">To use </a><i>Find</i>, a user has to type the string pattern that he/she is interested in, and then has to indicate which field to search in. For instance, in the example above, the user has to type “SINHA” and indicate to the system to search this string in the “LAST NAME” field. The user can specify either a single field or all fields to search.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Users cannot use <i>Find </i>command for creating an elaborate set of criteria for complex queries. Furthermore, <i>Find </i>command can operate on only one table at a time, and a user cannot save a specified criteria for future use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Query Language</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For handling complex quieries, all database systems support a query language. Most of these query languages conform to the SQL standard. In SQL, a user has to specify the criteria for search along with the fields and table (or tables) with which to work. Users can build the criteria for search by using relational operators (= [equal to], &gt; [greater than], &lt; [less than], and combinations of these operators), and logical operators (AND, OR, and NOT). For example, an SQL query to list the names of all employees whose last name starts with letter “S”, who belong to “PUNE”, and whose age is more than 40 years, looks as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SELECT [LAST NAME], [FIRST NAME], [MIDDLE NAME]</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FROM Employee</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WHERE ([LAST NAME] = “S..”) AND (CITY = “PUNE”) AND ([AGE &gt; 40])</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Keywords SELECT, FROM, and WHERE tell the SQL engine how to interpret each part of the query statement. SELECT keyword tells the SQL which fields to display for records that match the criteria. FROM keyword tells the SQL which table(s) to work with. WHERE keyword tells the SQL the criteria for selecting records (search criteria). This SQL query uses brackets […] around some field names because these field names contain spaces, and brackets help the database to interpret each field name correctly.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even a non-programmer can learn and use a query language easily, because the complexity of a query language statement is more or less of the same order as the above SQL statement. Furthermore, a query language uses only a few keywords that are easy to remember and use. In fact, SQL has only a few dozen or so basic keywords.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other advantages of a query language are that a user can use it for creating a query statement for an elaborate set of criteria for complex queries. It can operate on multiple tables at a time, and a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">user can save a specified criteria for future use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Query By Example (QBE)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although query languages are easy to learn and use, many database developers further simplify the job of specifying the search criteria. For this, they provide a simpler user interface (called front end) to a query language. A database user specifies the facts about a query by using this interface, and a query language builder composes query language statements automatically from the facts. Usually, front end consists of a form (called <i>QBE form</i>), and a user specifies a search criteria by inputting values into the fields of this form. The user may input values either by typing them, or by selecting an option from a set of options available for a field.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A QBE form collects all information from a user for composing query language statement(s) for a search criteria. Once the user completes the QBE form, the QBE engine converts the user inputs into suitable query language statement(s) for search processing. This front-end feature, called <i>query by example (QBE)</i>, relieves the users from remembering query language keywords and using them with correct syntax to form queries. It is userful for many database users, especially the beginners.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2074">Creating Reports</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A user of a database system can use the report generator to create a report by assembling the output of a database query in a desired format. For this, the user specifies the layout of various fields in the report. The user can also specify titles and subtitles for the report, column headings for various fields, and other elements, to make the report more presentable. Furthermore, the user can specify sorting parameters to obtain sorted output with respect to one or more fields in the report. When sorting is on more than one field, the user has to specify the primary, secondary, and tertiary key fields. A user can save a report and use it later for generating similar reports whenever required.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2075" class="s3">Figure </a>11.13<span class="s10"> </span><a href="part413.htm#bookmark2071" class="s23">shows a sample output of a report.

It is sorted in alphabetical order on last name of employees.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many database developers further simplify the job of database users by creating commonly</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">anticipated reports, storing them, and providing a simple graphical user interface to select from available reports. In this case, a user has to select one of the reports from the available options while outputting query results. A user needs to create a new report only when none of the available options meets his/her requirement. The user can add the newly created report to the list of available options for future use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part412.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part414.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
