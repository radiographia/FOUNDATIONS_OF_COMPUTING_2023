Main functions of most modern operating systems are process management, memory management,  file  management,  device  management,  security,  and  command interpretation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. We usually measure the efficiency of an operating system and the overall performance of a computer system in terms of its throughput, turnaround time, and response time.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <i>Throughput </i>is the amount of work that a system is able to do per unit time. We measure it as the number of jobs (processes) completed by the system per unit time.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. <i>Turnaround time </i>is the interval between the time of submission of a job to the system for processing and the time of completion of the job.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. <i>Response time </i>is the interval between the time of submission of a job to the system for processing and the time when the system produces the first response for the job.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. A <i>process </i>(also called <i>job</i>) is a program in execution. The main objective of process management module of an operating system is to manage the processes submitted to a system in a manner to minimize the idle time of processors (CPUs, I/O processors, etc.) of the system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">8. In <i>batch processing </i>method of job execution, job-to-job transition is automatic. This helps in reducing idle time of a computer system because job-to-job transition does not require any operator intervention.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">9. Operating systems use <i>control statements </i>to identify a new job and to determine the resources needed by it during its execution. Programmers write control statements in a language known as <i>job control language </i>(JCL).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">10. A <i>uniprogramming system </i>processes only one job at a time, and all system resources are available exclusively for the job until its completion.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. <i>CPU-bound jobs </i>mostly perform computations with little I/O operations. Hence, their CPU utilization is high.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">12. <i>I/O-bound jobs </i>mostly perform I/O operations with little computation. Hence, their CPU utilization is low.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">13. <i>Multiprogrammin</i>g is interleaved execution of two or more different and independent programs by a computer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">14. Some multiprogramming systems process only a fixed number of jobs concurrently (<i>multiprogramming with fixed tasks - MFT</i>), while others can process variable number of jobs concurrently ( <i>multiprogramming with variable tasks - MVT</i>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">15. In a multiprogramming system, the area occupied by each job residing simultaneously in the main memory is known as a <i>memory partition </i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">16. Part of the operating system that decides to which one of the ready jobs it should allocate the CPU is called <i>CPU scheduler</i>, and the algorithm it uses for this is called <i>CPU scheduling algorithm</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">17. <i>Multitasking </i>is interleaved execution of multiple jobs (often referred to as <i>tasks </i>of same user) in a single-user system.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">18. In <i>multithreading</i>, a process consists of an address space and one or more threads of control. Each thread of a process has its own program counter, its own register states, and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">its own stack. However, all the threads of a process share the same address space. We often refer to threads as <i>lightweight processes </i>and traditional processes as <i>heavyweight processes</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">19. Systems having multiple CPUs are called <i>multiprocessing systems</i>. They can execute multiple processes concurrently. These systems use multiple CPUs to process either instructions from different and independent programs or different instructions from the same program simultaneously.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">20. <i>Time-sharing </i>is a mechanism to provide simultaneous interactive use of a computer system by many users in such a manner that all users feel that he/she is the sole user of the system. It uses multiprogramming with a special CPU scheduling algorithm to achieve this.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">21. There are several resources in a system that multiple processes must not use simultaneously, if program operation is to be correct. An operating system must ensure exclusive access to such a shared resource by a process. This exclusiveness of access is called <i>mutual exclusion </i>between processes. We refer to the sections of a program that need exclusive access to shared resources as <i>critical sections</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">22. <i>Test-and-set </i>and <i>semaphore </i>are two commonly used approaches, which modern operating systems use to implement mutual exclusion.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">23. <i>Deadlock </i>is the state of permanent blocking of a set of processes each of which is waiting for an event that only another process in the set can cause. All the processes in the set block permanently, because all the processes are waiting and hence none of them will ever cause any of the events that could wake up any of the other members of the set.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">24. Memory management module of an operating system manages the main memory of a system. It keeps track of free and occupied (in use) parts of memory, allocates memory to processes when they need it, and de-allocates when they no more need.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">25. <i>Uniprogramming memory model </i>is suitable for those computer systems, which process only one job at a time, and all system resources are available exclusively for the job until it completes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">26. In a <i>multiprogramming memory model</i>, multiple user processes can reside simultaneously in main memory. The two memory management schemes, which operating systems use to facilitate this, are multiprogramming with fixed number of memory partitions and multiprogramming with variable number of memory partitions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">27. <i>External fragmentation </i>of memory is a situation when enough total free memory space exists to satisfy the memory need of a process, but the operating system cannot load the process in memory because the available free memory is not contiguous (is fragmented into multiple free blocks of memory).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">28. <i>Internal fragmentation </i>is a situation when the operating system allocates more memory to a process than its actual memory requirement because of the memory allocation mechanism of the operating system. The additional memory allocated to the process remains unutilized because neither the process uses it, nor the operating system can allocate it to any other process for use.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">29. <i>Paging </i>is a memory management mechanism that operating systems use to solve external fragmentation problem. It does this by allowing a process&#39;s memory to be noncontiguous,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and allocating physical memory to a process from wherever free memory blocks are available.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">30. <i>Virtual memory </i>is a memory management scheme that allows execution of a process without the need to load the process in main memory completely. The three basic concepts, which virtual memory mechanism uses for its realization are on-line secondary storage, swapping, and demand paging.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">31. A <i>file </i>is a collection of related information. Every file has a name, its data, and attributes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">32. File management module of an operating system takes care of file-related activities, such as structuring, accessing, naming, sharing, and protection of files.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">33. Operating systems use <i>directories </i>to map file names to their corresponding file attributes and file data, and to provide greater flexibility to users in file naming.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">34. Disk space allocation methods deal with how to allocate space to multiple files on disk. The three methods that operating systems use commonly for disk space allocation are contiguous allocation, linked allocation, and indexed allocation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">35. Device management module of an operating system takes care of controlling the I/O devices of a computer system and provides a simple and easy to use interface to these devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">36. <i>Spooling </i>(<b>S</b>imultaneous <b>P </b>eripheral <b>O</b>peration <b>O</b>n- <b>L</b>ine) is a mechanism to reduce speed mismatch between slow I/O devices and CPU, and to convert mutually exclusive (non- sharable) I/O devices into non-mutually exclusive (sharable) I/O devices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">37. Command interpretation module (known as <i>command interpreter</i>) of an operating system provides a set of commands, which users use to give instructions to a computer for execution of their jobs. Two broad categories of user interfaces supported by modern operating systems are command-line interface and graphical user interface (GUI).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">38. The <i>kernel </i>of an operating system is its central controlling part, which implements the most primitive of the system&#39;s functions. It is the only part of an operating system, which a user cannot replace or modify.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">39. Those modules of an operating system, which need to be always resident in system&#39;s main memory, are called <i>resident modules, </i>whereas those that reside on hard disk are called <i>non-resident modules</i>. The operating system loads a non-resident module into the memory on demand (whenever a user process needs it for execution).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">40. <i>OS capability enhancement software </i>is a special category of software, which bridges the gap between functionality of an operating system and needs of users for frequently used programs. Normally, we group such software into three categories - translating programs, library programs, and utility programs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">41. Some popular operating systems are UNIX, MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Windows Server, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, Watch OS and Android OS.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">42. A <i>real-time system </i>is a system that satisfies the requirement of producing the desired results before a specified deadline. Real-time systems use a special type of operating system called <i>real-time operating system</i>. The main goal of CPU scheduling in real-time operating systems is to process as may time-critical processes as possible, and to meet their deadlines.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">43. A <i>distributed computing system </i>is a collection of computer systems interconnected by a communication network.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">44. Two types of operating systems used commonly for distributed computing systems are <i>network operating systems </i>and <i>distributed operating systems</i>. In case of a network operating system, users view a distributed computing system as a collection of distinct computers connected by a communication subsystem. However, in case of a distributed operating system, users view the system as a “virtual single system”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part397.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part399.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
