Some obvious benefits of IoT in all areas of its application are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2351">1. </a><b>Increased accuracy. </b>IoT helps increase accuracy. For example, consider the following scenarios. Cameras installed at smart traffic signals sense the density of traffic flow in different directions at different time of the day, enabling automatic adjustment of the time of red, green and yellow lights with greater accuracy, thus optimizing the waiting time of vehicles at traffic signals. Similarly, in factories, sensors installed with smart machinery, signal the accurate time when some component of the machinery has worn out to the point needing replacement, resulting in increased safety and maintenance cost optimization.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Increased efficiency. </b>IoT enables automation in almost all fields resulting in increased efficiency. For example, consider the following scenario. A patient is being rushed to a hospital in an ambulance. The ambulance signals approaching traffic lights, which turn green to allow the ambulance to drive through without stopping/waiting at traffic signals. It also transfers patient&#39;s health statistics to the hospital so that doctors are ready with the necessary treatment as soon as the patient arrives.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Reduced wastage. </b>IoT helps reduce wastage in many situations. For example, consider the following scenario. In precision farming, sensors monitor moisture content of soil and farmers supply water to soil only when required and in the required quantity, rather than watering the crops in crude manner. This helps reduce wastage of water. Similarly, sensors provide information on infected crops and farmers spray insecticide only in infected areas, rather than in the entire field spread across several acres of land. This helps reduce wastage of insecticide and the effort involved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Improved customer satisfaction. </b>IoT helps provide improved customer satisfaction in all fields. For example, consider the following scenario. Sensors installed in a car signal the driver about some part not functioning properly. The GPS system in the car informs the driver of the nearest service station. The sensor in the car communicates with the service station to inform about the faulty part so that the mechanic takes it out from his warehouse and keeps it ready. The mechanic replaces the faulty part and rectifies the problem as soon as the driver arrives at the service station with the car for getting it repaired.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part502.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part504.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
