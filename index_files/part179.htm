The differences among the three are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>On-line storage. </b>An on-line storage device is under direct control of the processing unit of the computer to which it belongs. It provides rapid access to data on a constant basis. It stores all frequently used data. Computer systems often use SSD, hard disk or disk array as an on-line storage device.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Near-line storage. </b>A near-line storage device is an intermediate storage between on-line storage and off-line storage. It means nearly on-line. It is so called because it is slower than on-line storage, but data can still be accessed from it without any human intervention (off-line storage requires human intervention). Computer systems use near-line storage to store infrequently used data. They often use mass storage devices such as tape library, CD jukebox, etc. as a near-line storage device.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Off-line storage. </b>An off-line storage is not under direct control of any computer. A user records data on it using a computer and then physically removes or disconnects it for storing away from the computer. Hence, it is also known as <i>disconnected storage</i>. To reuse data stored on it, a human operator has to insert it or connect it to a computer system. Hence, it requires human intervention for storage/retrieval of data on/from it. Computer systems often use magnetic tape, magnetic disk, optical disk, and memory storage devices as an off-line storage device.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Users often use off-line storage to transfer data between two computers, which are not physically connected. They also use it for off-line data backup to prevent loss of data in case of a disaster at computer&#39;s site, for example a fire, flood, or earthquake. Off-line storage (with backup data) kept at a remote location remains unaffected, enabling disaster recovery. Off-line storage also provides information security against computer-based attack because data on off-line storage is</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">physically inaccessible from a computer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part178.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part180.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
