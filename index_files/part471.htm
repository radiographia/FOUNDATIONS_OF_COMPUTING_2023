Out of these, some popular ones are described here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1G, 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G Technologies</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The era of mobile wireless communication started in 1980. Mobile phones (also known as cell phones because they communicate through cellular networks consisting of cells) and other hand- held mobile communication devices use mobile wireless communication technologies. These technologies have undergone considerable changes since 1980 and a new set of mobile wireless communication technologies has been released roughly every ten years. It has been a practice to categorize a new set of mobile wireless communication technologies as a “Generation” and represent it as “G”. Hence, the first set of such technologies is referred to as 1G (first generation), the second set is referred to as 2G (second generation), and so on. Till date, five such sets of technologies are there, leading to 5G, which is yet to come.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2260">Every new generation made mobile wireless communication faster than before and had improved or new features than earlier generation technologies. To take advantage of the advanced features of a new generation, consumers need to obtain new mobile devices (like a new phone) that supports the new generation, and service providers need to make expensive upgrades to their cellular networks. We describe here the five generations of mobile wireless communication technologies.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>1G. </b>Mobile phones were first introduced in early 1980s based on 1G technologies. They could be used for only voice services and had maximum communication speed of 2.4 Kbps. They used analog signals for voice transmission. The technology standard for 1G is called <i>Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS)</i>. 1G was characterized by poor voice quality, poor battery life, large phone size, poor handoff reliability leading to frequent call drop, and poor security.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>2G. </b>Mobile phones based on 2G technologies were introduced in 1991. They could be used for text, picture and multimedia message transmission (SMS and MMS), in addition to voice services. They had maximum data communication speed of 64 Kbps. They used digital signals for both data and voice transmission. The technology standards for 2G are called <i>Global System for Mobile (GSM) </i>and <i>Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)</i>. 2G enabled use of mobile phones for SMS, MMS, conference calls, call hold, and billing based services. As compared to 1G, 2G was characterized by better voice quality, better data handling capability, smaller phone size, better handoff reliability leading to fewer call drop, and better security. 2G still had the limitation of handling complex data such as videos. Few years later, 2.5G was introduced to provide higher data communication speed. It offered maximum data communication speed of 384 Kbps.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>3G. </b>Mobile phones based on 3G technologies were introduced in 2000. In addition to voice services and transmission of text, pictures and multimedia data, they could also be</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">used for video data transmission. 3G mobile phones used digital signals and Wide Band Wireless Network. They had data communication speed in the range of 144 Kbps to 2 Mbps, depending on whether the mobile device during its use is stationary (like user is sitting at a place), moving slowly (like user is walking), or moving fast (like user is moving in a car or train). Hence, data communication speed of at least 144 Kbps was one of the requirements to qualify for 3G. The technology standards for 3G are called <i>Code Division  Multiple  Access  2000  (CDMA  2000)  </i>in  America,  <i>Universal  Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS</i>) in Europe, and <i>Enhanced Data Rate for GSM Evolution (EDGE)</i>. 3G enabled use of mobile phones for “true” multimedia messaging including text, images, voice and video data, video chatting, video conferencing, mobile TV, video games, and web-based applications like e-mail and mobile e-commerce. As compared to 2G, 3G was characterized by better voice quality, better data handling capability, better handoff reliability leading to fewer call drop, global roaming facility, and better security features. People started calling mobile phones having such advanced capabilities as “smart phones”.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>4G. </b>Mobile phones based on 4G technologies were introduced in 2010. The aim of 4G was to offer much higher speed of voice and multimedia data communication, better quality of service, improved security features, internet over IP, and all these at much lower cost. 4G offers data communication speed in the range of 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps. The maximum speed of a 4G network when the device is moving fast (like user is moving in a car or train) is 100 Mbps and in case of stationary or slow moving devices (like user is sitting at a place or walking) is 1 Gbps. The technology standard for 4G is called <i>Long Term Evolution (LTE)</i>. 4G networks are based on all Internet Protocol (all-IP) packet- switching technology. Earlier generations used only circuit-switching technology (1G and 2G) or a combination of circuit-switching and packet-switching technologies (3G). Two key technologies used in LTE are MIMO (<i>Multiple Input Multiple Output</i>) and OFDM ( <i>Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing</i>). 4G enabled use of mobile phones for mobile web access with sophisticated graphical user interfaces, high definition quality mobile TV (HDTV), video conferencing with mobile devices, IP telephony, high-end mobile gaming services, and mobile cloud computing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2261">5. </a><b>5G. </b>Mobile phones based on 5G technologies are expected to be introduced soon. 5G promises to offer significantly faster data communication speed, higher connectivity density with many more mobile devices in use (approximately 100 billion devices), much wider overall wireless coverage, improved security, and many newer types of mobile applications (like driverless cars, IoT applications, etc.) as compared to previous generations. 5G is being designed to offer maximum data communication speed of 35.46 Gbps, which is 35 times faster than 4G. The technology standard for 5G is called <i>Wireless World Wide Web (WWWW)</i>. Two key technologies used in WWWW are <i>Massive MIMO </i>and <i>Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications</i>. 5G will enable use of mobile phones for mobile web access with sophisticated graphical user interfaces, high definition quality mobile TV (HDTV), video conferencing with mobile devices, IP telephony, high-end mobile gaming services, mobile cloud computing, interactive multimedia applications, mobile applications based on device-to-device communication (IoT applications), etc., with far better experience than before.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part471.htm#bookmark2262" class="s3">Figure </a>12.24<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">provides a summary of the five generations of mobile wireless communication</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">technologies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="294" alt="image" src="Image_735.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 230pt;text-indent: -221pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2262">Figure 12.24. </a><span class="s21">Summary of five generations of mobile wireless communication technologies (1G, 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wireless LAN (WLAN)</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A <i>Wireless Local Area Network </i>(<i>WLAN</i>) is a LAN that enables wireless communication among the equipment, which are part of the LAN. It may be connected further to a more extensive fixed network such as a LAN, WAN, or the Internet. Wireless interface card that has an antenna is the primary component of a wireless LAN. This card is connected to a mobile unit as well as to the fixed network. A wireless LAN has limited range and usually operates in local environments such as a building, hallway, park, or office complex. Its main advantage is that it supports flexibility and mobility, but it has low communication bandwidth. IEEE 802.11 is a popular WLAN standard. <i>Wi-Fi </i>is the embedded technology of WLAN based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. Although it was originally developed for supporting mobile computing devices (such as laptops) in LANs, it is now increasingly used for many other services, including Internet and VoIP phone access, gaming, and basic connectivity of consumer electronics products such as televisions, digital cameras, and DVD players.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following three are the primary WLAN standards:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>IEEE 802.11. </b>The IEEE 802.11 standard supports 1 Mbps data rate and several choices of physical medium such as spread spectrum and infrared. It also supports prioritized access to the medium. An additional feature of this standard is battery conservation for inactive or idle wireless users. Many universities and companies are encouraging the use of IEEE 802.11-based  LANs  for  accessing  campus  computing  systems  and  the  Internet. Enhancement of this standard to support 11 Mbps data rate is underway.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2263">2. </a><b>HiperLAN. </b>The HiperLAN standard supports 23.5 Mbps channel rates. It, however, allows the use of only spread spectrum physical medium. Like IEEE 802.11, it also supports prioritized access to the medium.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>HiperLAN2. </b>HiperLAN2 is a WLAN standard, which is standardized by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standard Institute). An exciting feature of this standard is that it provides for use of connections that offer different quality of service for different applications. It uses time-division multiplexing of unicast, multicast, and broadcast connections. Many major players in WLAN area have formed HiperLAN2 Global Forum to advance and complement the ETSI standardization process.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WiMAX</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><i>WiMAX </i>stands for <b>W</b>orldwide <b>I</b>nteroperability for <b>M</b>icrowave <b>A</b>ccess. It is a technology based on the IEEE 802.16 for providing wireless data communication in WMANs (Wireless Metropolitan-Area Networks). It supports both point-to-point link and full mobile cellular type access. It is useful for providing communication facility in those areas where we do not have copper network or cable TV network (often referred to as <i>last mile connectivity</i>). It has the added advantage of interoperability and economies of scale due to international standardization. It currently operates in the frequency band of 3.3 to 3.4 GHz.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Wireless Local Loops (WLLs)</h4><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Wireless Local Loops <span class="p">(</span>WLLs<span class="p">) technology supports fixed wireless systems. It provides several MHz of bandwidth, which can offer high-speed Internet access and data transfer service, in addition to basic telephone service. These loops allow long-distance carriers to bypass the existing wired local loops owned by local telephone carriers (which may result in the saving of tremendous access charges). Due to this reason, many long-distance companies in advanced countries (like the U.S.) are looking to build their own WLLs to avoid paying access charges. Moreover, in developing nations where laying of thousands of miles of copper cable is impractical, WLLs can be used to provide telephone and low-speed data transfer services.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Among many choices of technologies for WLL environments, cellular and microcellular systems can be used in the 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz ranges with 9.6 Kbps for 10 to 100 users within a few kilometers range. Network designers can deploy wireless LANs to support WLL for users in smaller areas, but with higher bandwidth requirements. Specially designed systems for fixed wireless access, such as Local Multipoint Distribution Systems (LMDS), can provide high bandwidth (tens of Mbps) in large areas for large number of users, but require a direct line of sight.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Radio-router Technology</h4><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Radio-router technology <span class="p">uses a radio-transmission framework for packet-based, broadband, IP wireless communications. It enables building of a radio-router network on top of an existing IP infrastructure, rather than from the ground up like a 4G network. Since IP network technology is already well developed and inexpensive, radio-router systems are relatively easy, quick, and economical to implement.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It uses OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) technology, which divides a single channel into several sub-channels, each at a different frequency. This boosts bandwidth by letting a system carry several transmissions at the same time. Radio-router systems offer a maximum throughput of 1.5 Mbps. OFDM, unlike traditional FDM, uses signal modulation and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">demodulation techniques, as well as orthogonal placement of adjacent channels, to minimize interference.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2264">Multihop Wireless Networks</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Most wireless network environments use radio channel to connect mobile equipment to a base station in a single hop. The base station itself is part of a wired infrastructure. Consider an environment where there is no wired infrastructure, yet the communication system must maintain connectivity among users who can move around arbitrarily and can at times not be in direct transmission  range  of  each  other.<i>Multihop  wireless  networks</i>,  also  known  as  <i>instant infrastructure systems</i>, provide wireless communications capability in such environments.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Instant infrastructure systems play an important role in wireless communication because due to transmitted power constraints, not all radios are within the range of each other. Hence, these systems often need to relay packets from one radio to another to deliver the packets to their intended destinations. These systems, however, are more complex to design and manage than traditional single-hop, centrally controlled systems. This is because they need to have complete support for multimedia, multihopping, and mobility features.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We saw in the discussion above that many different wireless access technologies exist that are not interoperable. Designing and building networks and applications for each technology would be a difficult job for developers. With the proliferation of the Internet and wireless communications devices, Internet access using mobile devices became important for anywhere, anytime information access capability. However, redesigning of all web sites to support downloading of information by mobile users was certainly not feasible. To address these issues, researchers started working towards the development of a technology that could allow development of applications that are independent of the underlying wireless access technology and that could enable access of information from existing web sites using mobile devices. The result of this was <i>wireless application protocol </i>(WAP).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part471.htm#bookmark2265" class="s23">WAP Forum, a consortium of leading wireless companies, developed WAP specifications. WAP supports interoperability of different wireless networks, devices, and applications using a common set of application and network protocols. In fact, WAP is a stack of protocols, which defines the type and structure of messages that two devices have to use for communicating with each other in a wireless environment. WAP protocol stack contains a set of six layers, which are application layer, session layer, transaction layer, security layer, transport layer, and wireless layer. </a><a href="part471.htm#bookmark2265" class="s3">Figure </a><span class="s46">12.25</span> presents a summary of the various WAP layers, the protocols at each layer, and their functions. WAP protocols reduce the problems associated with the use of the Internet protocols for wireless data transfer. They do this by reducing communication data volume by eliminating unnecessary data transfers and using binary code. For instance, WAP has introduced a new Markup Language called the <i>Wireless Markup Language </i>(WML), which is a version of HTML optimized for mobile devices.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part471.htm#bookmark2267" class="s3">Figure </a>12.26<span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">shows the basic architecture of WAP, which is similar to web architecture, but it uses a WAP gateway for HTTP to WAP and WAP to HTTP translations. That is, the WAP gateway acts as a proxy server to a mobile client and translates requests from WAP protocol</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">stacks to protocol stacks of the information server. The WAP gateway has encoders to translate the content coming from the server into compact formats to reduce the size of data over the wireless network. Usually, the WAP gateway resides in the company or organization, which provides carrier services to its subscribers. This architecture allows mobile users to access a wide variety of contents and applications. It also allows application developers to build content services and applications that can run on a variety of mobile devices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="275" alt="image" src="Image_736.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2265">Figure 12.25. </a><span class="s21">Various WAP layers, protocols at each layer, and their functions.</span><a name="bookmark2266">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="438" height="106" alt="image" src="Image_737.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark2267">Figure 12.26. </a><span class="s21">Basic architecture of WAP.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part470.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part472.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
