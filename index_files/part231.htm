Hence, logic errors are more difficult to locate and correct than syntax errors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, once the testing of a program indicates the presence of a logic error in it, a programmer uses one or more of the following methods to locate and correct the error:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Doing hand simulation of the program code. </b>One approach is to take a printout of the source code of the program and go through its execution manually with the test data input that produced incorrect results. During manual execution, the programmer follows the same sequence of paths that a computer would follow for the test data, while keeping track of changes in values of various variables that come across during the execution. Before he/she completes manual execution of the program, he/she will most likely detect the cause of the problem. This method is suitable only for simple and small programs because manual execution of a program is a tedious process.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Putting print statements in the program code. </b>In this approach, the programmer puts several print/write statements at appropriate locations in the program so that during execution of the program, the computer prints/displays values of different variables to indicate intermediate computations results. The programmer re-compiles the program with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">these statements and executes it. These statements print/display the values of intermediate computations, telling what is happening during the execution of the program. By doing a proper analysis of the printed/displayed intermediate results, the programmer can detect the cause of the problem. The programmer removes the print/write statements from the program after correcting the detected errors, and re-compiles the program for future executions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Using a debugger. </b>This is the most commonly used approach. <i>Debugger </i>is a software tool that assists a programmer in following a program&#39;s execution step-by-step by allowing him/her to display intermediate calculation results and field values whenever desired. In effect, a debugger helps a programmer in debugging a program&#39;s logic more easily than having to put (and later remove) print/write statements into the program&#39;s source code. Almost all modern programming language processors support some kind of debugger.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When using a debugger for debugging program logic, the programmer can move either from statement to statement or from one checkpoint to another, pausing the execution of the program as needed to examine the values of key variables or machine registers. Most debuggers support two kinds of checkpoints called breakpoints and watchpoints as explained here:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">a. <i>Breakpoint. </i>A breakpoint is a point at which the debugger stops during program execution and awaits further command from the user. When it stops, the user may instruct it to display the current values of key variables or machine registers. A debugger provides the flexibility of setting or removing breakpoints after any program statement. The user may even set multiple breakpoints, and set or remove breakpoints when the program execution stops at a breakpoint and awaits further command.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1440">b. </a><i>Watchpoint. </i>Suppose a program contains a variable named “radius” whose initial value of 5 is not supposed to change during execution of the program or after some point in the program. However, during debugging of the program, a programmer discovers that its value is changing. To know the exact point in the program where its value is changed, the programmer can declare “radius” as a watch variable. Then the debugger keeps track of the variable “radius” and the moment its value changes, it stops after the statement that causes the value of the variable “radius” to change and awaits further command from the programmer.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Both kinds of checkpoints are helpful in detecting logic errors in programs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Using memory dump. </b>Generally, programmers use this approach when the program “hangs up” during a test run. In this approach, a programmer prints/displays the contents of main memory and CPU registers at the time when the program hangs up. This information, called <i>memory dump </i>or <i>storage dump, </i>lists the instructions and data held in the computer&#39;s main memory and CPU registers in their raw form, that is, their binary or equivalent hexadecimal or octal form. By doing a proper analysis of this listing, the programmer can detect the cause of the problem.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part230.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part232.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
