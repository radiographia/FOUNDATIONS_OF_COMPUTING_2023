A computer is a fast calculating device. It is also known as a data processor because it can store, process, and retrieve data whenever desired.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. The activity of processing data using a computer is called <i>data processing</i>. <i>Data </i>is raw material used as input to data processing and <i>information </i>is processed data obtained as output of data processing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">3. Key characteristics of computers are: automatic, speed, accuracy, diligence, versatility, memory, lack of intelligence, and lack of feelings.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4. Charles Babbage is considered the father of modern digital programmable computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">5. Some of the well-known early computers are: MARK I (1937-44), ABC (1939-42), ENIAC (1943-46), EDVAC (1946-52), EDSAC (1947-49), UNIVAC I (1951), IBM-701</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(1952), and IBM-650 (1953).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">6. Dr. John Von Neumann introduced the “stored program” concept that considerably influenced the development of modern digital computers. Due to this feature, we often refer to modern digital computers as stored program digital computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">7. “Generation” in computer talk provides a framework for the growth of computer industry based on key technologies developed. Originally, it was used to distinguish between hardware technologies but was later extended to include both hardware and software technologies.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">8. Till date, there are five computer generations - first, second, third, fourth, and fifth.</p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part21.htm#bookmark664" class="s23">9. </a><a href="part21.htm#bookmark664" class="s3">Figure  </a>1.5<span class="s10">  </span><span class="p">summarizes  the  key  hardware  and  software  technologies  and  key characteristics of computers of five computer generations.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">10. Traditionally, computers were classified as microcomputers, minicomputers, mainframes, and supercomputers based on their size, processing speed, and cost. However, with rapidly changing technology this classification is no longer relevant.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">11. Today, computers are classified based on their mode of use. According to this classification, computers are classified as notebook computers, personal computers, workstations, mainframe systems, supercomputers, client and server computers, and handheld computers.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">12. <i>Notebook computers </i>(or <i>Laptops</i>) are portable computers that are small enough to fit inside a briefcase, light enough to carry around easily, and operate with chargeable batteries so that users can use them even at places with no external power source available. They normally run MS-DOS, MS-WINDOWS, Mac OS or Linux operating system. Users use them commonly for word processing, spreadsheet computing, data entry, Internet browsing, accessing and sending e-mails, and preparing presentation materials while a person is travelling.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">13. A <i>personal computer </i>is a non-portable, general-purpose computer that fits on a normal size office table, and only one person uses it at a time. PCs meet personal computing needs of individuals either at their work places or at their homes. They normally run MS- DOS, MS-Windows (comprising Windows XP, Vista), Mac OS, Linux, or UNIX operating system, and support multitasking enabling a user to switch between tasks.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">14. A <i>workstation </i>is a powerful desktop computer designed to meet computing needs of engineers, architects, and other professionals, who need greater processing power, larger storage, and better graphics display facility than what normal PCs provide. Users use workstations commonly for computer-aided design, multimedia applications, simulation of complex scientific and engineering problems, and visualization of results of simulation. Workstations generally run server version of Windows, Mac OS, Linux or UNIX operating system and support multi-user environment.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">15. <i>Mainframe systems </i>are used for meeting the computing needs of mid to large size organizations such as banks, insurance companies, hospitals, railways, etc. They are also used in such environments where a large number of users need to share a common computing facility such as in research groups, educational institutions, engineering firms, etc. A typical configuration of a mainframe system consists of a host computer, a front- end computer, a back-end computer, one or more console terminals, several magnetic disk drives, a few tape drives, a magnetic tape library, several user terminals, several printers, and one or more plotters. Mainframe systems having smaller configuration (slower host and subordinate computers, lesser storage space, and fewer user terminals) are known as <i>minicomputers.</i></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">16. <i>Supercomputers </i>are the most powerful and expensive computers available at any given time. Users use them primarily for processing complex scientific applications requiring enormous processing power. Some supercomputing applications are analysis of large volumes of seismic data, simulation of airflow around an aircraft, crash simulation of an automobile design, solving complex structural engineering problems, genome sequence analysis in bioinformatics, design of new materials, creation of special effects in movies, and weather forecasting.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">17. Modern supercomputers use multiprocessing and parallel processing technologies to solve complex problems faster, and hence, they are also known as <i>parallel computers </i>or<i>parallel processing systems</i>. They are also known as <i>massively parallel processors </i>because they use thousands of processors.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">18. A <i>handheld computer </i>is a device whose size, weight, and design are such that a user can use it by holding it in hand. It is also known as <i>palmtop </i>because it can be kept on palm and operated. Some popular handheld computers are tablet PC, PDA/Pocket PC, and smartphone.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">19. In client-server computing environment, a <i>client </i>is generally a single-user system that provides user-friendly interface to end users. It runs client processes that send service requests to a server. A <i>server </i>is a relatively powerful system that manages a shared resource and/or provides a set of shared user services to the clients. It runs a server process that services client requests for use of the shared resource managed by it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">20. A set of computers interconnected together to form a client-server computing environment is collectively known as a <i>distributed computing system </i>or <i>distributed system</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">21. <i>Client-server computing </i>involves splitting an application into tasks and putting each task on a computer, which can handle it most efficiently. Computers and operating systems of a client and server may be different. As long as a client and server share a common communication protocol and support the same applications, these lower-level differences are irrelevant.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">22. In a client-server computing environment, it is common for one server to use the services of another server, and hence, be both a client and a server at the same time. Hence, the concept of client and server computers is purely role-based and may change dynamically as the role of a computer changes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part28.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part30.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
