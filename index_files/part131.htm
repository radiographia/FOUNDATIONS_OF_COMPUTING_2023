They are broadly classified as:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1083">1. </a><b>Sequential-access devices. </b>A <i>sequential-access storage device </i>is one in which arrival at a desired storage location is preceded by sequencing through other locations so that access time varies according to location. That is, we can retrieve information stored on a sequential-access device only in the same sequence in which it is stored. In case of a sequential-access device, if we need to access an address that is out of order, we can reach at it only by traversing through all the addresses stored before it. For instance, to access the 28<span class="s22">th </span>data record stored on a sequential-access device, a computer must first access (although not process) the first 27 data records.</p><p style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="274" alt="image" src="Image_336.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1084">Figure 5.1. </a><span class="s21">Commonly used secondary storage devices and their classification.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sequential access devices are suitable for storing data of such applications, which need to process most (if not all) data records one after another. Preparations of monthly pay slips, monthly electricity bills, etc., are examples of such applications. These applications process data records of every employee or customer at scheduled intervals (in this case monthly).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Magnetic tape is an example of a sequential-access storage device.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Direct/Random-access devices. </b>A <i>direct-access </i>or <i>random-access storage device </i>is one in which we can reach and access any storage location at random, and approximately equal access time is required for accessing each location.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Direct-access devices are useful for such applications, which need to access information in a more direct manner than sequential-access devices allow. For example, in a computerized bank, at any instance, we may require to determine the exact balance in a customer&#39;s savings account. Similarly, in a computerized airline ticket booking system, we may require immediate access to reservation system records to find out, if seats are available on a particular flight. In such applications, if we use a sequential-access device for data storage, accessing desired information may take a long time, causing frustration to the customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Magnetic disks, optical disks, solid state drive and memory storage devices are examples of direct-access storage devices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part130.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part132.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
