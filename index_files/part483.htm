An e-mail message takes a few seconds to several minutes to reach its destination, because it travels from one network to another, until it reaches its destination.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2313">E-mail service has many similarities with postal-mail service. All Internet users have an e-mail address, just as all of us have a postal address. Each Internet user has a logical mailbox, just as each one of us has a mailbox in our house. When sending a mail to another user, a sender specifies the e-mail address of the receiver, just as we write postal address of the receiver of a post in postal mail system. E-mail service delivers an already sent mail into its receiver&#39;s mailbox. The receiver extracts the mail from his/her mailbox and reads it at his/her own convenient time, just as in a postal-mail system. After reading the message, the receiver can save it, delete it, forward it to someone else, or respond to it by sending another message back.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Messages in e-mail service can contain not only text documents but also image, audio, and video data. Only restriction is that the data must be in computer-readable format.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With e-mail service, the Internet has proved to be a rapid and productive communication tool for millions of users. Users prefer e-mail to paper mail, telephone, and fax because of its following advantages:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. It is faster than paper mail.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Unlike telephone, the persons communicating need not be available at the same time.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">3. Unlike fax documents, the receiver of an e-mail document can store it in a computer, and can edit it using editing programs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part482.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part484.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
