Extraction of different kinds of patterns requires different types of algorithms. Popular classes of algorithms for data mining are:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Classification,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Clustering,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Association, and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 165%;text-align: left;">4. Trend analysis They are described here.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Classification</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Classification algorithms classify the objects of a database (based on their attributes) into one of several predefined categorical classes. A classification algorithm first takes a set of objects as training set, and represents every object in this set by a vector of attributes along with its class. It then constructs a classification function or model by analyzing the relationship between the attributes and the classes of the objects in the training set. It then applies this classification function or model to all objects in a database to classify them into the already defined classes. This helps a user in having a better understanding of the classes of the objects in the database.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A simple application of classification algorithm is to classify patient records of a patient database into different classes of diseases. Personal and clinical data of a patient&#39;s record may be the attributes for classification. Hospital management personnel often need such classified information to make decisions such as how many doctors and other staff should they employ with certain speciality and skills, how many beds should they provide in different sections of the hospital, what types of medicines and in how much quantity should they stock.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clustering</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Clustering algorithms partition the data space of a database into a set of clusters, and assign each object in a database to a cluster, either deterministically or probabilistically. A clustering algorithm identifies all sets of similar objects in a database, in some optimal fashion. It clusters the objects in a manner to maximize intra-cluster (objects belonging to the same cluster) similarities, and minimize inter-cluster (objects belonging to different clusters) similarities. It does this based on some criteria defined on the attributes of the objects. Once it decides the clusters, it summarizes the common features for objects in a cluster to form cluster description.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2110">It is important to understand the difference between classification and clustering algorithms. A classification algorithm classifies the objects of a database into predefined classes, whose</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">number is predetermined before application of the classification algorithm to the database. However, a clustering algorithm groups the objects of a database into clusters, whose number is unknown before application of the clustering algorithm to the database. Thus, if we apply the same classification algorithm to two different databases, both will result in the same predefined number of classes (say <i>n</i>, some of which may be null, if no object maps to them). On the other hand, if we apply the same clustering algorithm to two different databases, both may result in different, previously unknown number of clusters (say <i>m </i>and <i>n</i>). Also note that common features of objects in a class are pre-defined in a classification algorithm, but common features of objects in a cluster are summarized after all the objects have been put in the cluster.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A simple application of clustering algorithm is to group the customers of a bank from its customer database into several groups based on similarities of their age, sex, income, and residence.  After  grouping  the  customers,  bank  management  can  examine  summarized characteristics of each subgroup, extract significant statistics, and use them to understand its customers better, for offering more suitable products and customized services. Text mining area also uses clustering algorithms for solving problems such as document indexing and topic identification in research settings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Association</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Association algorithms discover association rules hidden in a database. An association rule reveals associative relationships among objects. For example, an association rule may reveal a relationship such as “If some object <i>X </i>is a part of a transaction, then for some percentage of such transactions, object <i>Y </i>is also a part of the transaction”. Thus, association algorithms help in discovery of togetherness, or connection of objects. They are useful in solving those problems, in which it is important to understand the extent to which presence of some variables imply the presence of other variables, and prevalence of this pattern in the entire database under examination.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An interesting application of association algorithm is market-basket analysis. It examines databases of sales transactions to extract patterns, which provide answers to sales-related queries such as:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. What items sell together?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. What items sell better when relocated to new areas?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. What product groupings improve department sales?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For example, market-basket analysis of a retail store&#39;s database may reveal that customers tend to buy soft drinks and potato chips together. Store personnel then place potato chips near soft drinks to promote the sale of both items. They may even offer some discount to a customer who buys both the items (on combination purchase).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another useful application of association algorithm is analysis of Internet traffic on a website. Web designers use the results of such analysis to understand the information needs of users, and to organize the locations of web pages and linkages among them to make the website more convenient to use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trend Analysis</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Several large databases have time series data with timestamp (they accumulate records over time). For example, a company&#39;s sales data over several years/months, a customer&#39;s credit card transactions over a period, and fluctuations in stock prices over a period, are examples of time series data. Users can analyze such data to find certain historical trends. Trend analysis algorithms discover patterns and regularities in data evolutions along with time dimension. Users often find such patterns useful in making decisions for larger benefits in future.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A simple application of trend analysis algorithm is to analyze historical trend of fluctuations in stock prices of various companies to predict future behavior. Stock market investors use such analysis results effectively to make investment decisions for better profitability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part426.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part428.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
