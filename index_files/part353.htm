Comparatively, multiprogramming is interleaved execution of two or more processes by a single-CPU system. Hence, while multiprogramming involves execution of a portion of one program, then a portion of another, etc., in brief consecutive periods, multiprocessing involves simultaneous execution of several program segments of the same or different programs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Advantages and Limitations of Multiprocessing</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multiprocessing systems have the following advantages:</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1889">1. </a><b>Better performance. </b>They have better performance (shorter response times and higher throughput) than single-processor systems. For example, if we have to run two different programs, a two-processor system is evidently more powerful than a single-processor system because the two-processor system can run both programs on different processors simultaneously. Similarly, if we can partition a large computation job into multiple sub- computations (sub-processes) that can run concurrently, a multiprocessor system with sufficient number of processors can run all sub-processes simultaneously, with each one on a different processor (popularly known as <i>parallel processing</i>). However, the speed-up ratio with <i>n </i>processors is not <i>n</i>, but less than <i>n</i>. This is because when multiple processors cooperate to execute the processes or sub-processes, the operating system incurs certain amount of overhead in keeping everything working correctly. This overhead, plus contention for shared resources, lowers the expected gains from additional processors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="389" height="266" alt="image" src="Image_616.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1890">Figure. 10.10. </a><span class="s21">Difference between tightly coupled and loosely coupled multiprocessing systems.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Better reliability. </b>They also have better reliability than single-processor systems. In a properly designed multiprocessor system, if one of the processors breaks down, the system can continue to function with remaining processors. Hence, the system can tolerate partial failure of processors and can avoid a complete breakdown. For example, if a system has 4 processors and one fails, then the system can utilize the remaining 3 processors to process the jobs. Thus, the entire system runs only 25% slower, rather than failing altogether. This ability of a system to continue providing service proportional to the level of non-failed hardware is called <i>graceful degradation </i>feature.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multiprocessing systems, however, require a sophisticated operating system to schedule, balance, and coordinate the input, output, and processing activities of multiple processors. Designing such an operating system is complex and time taking. Moreover, multiprocessing systems have higher initial cost and their regular operation and maintenance is costlier than single-processor systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part352.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part354.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
